"Had a very attentive server explaining the ingredients behind the dishes. The menu is well marked for common allergens such as nuts, gluten, alliums, etc. We absolutely loved the vegan meatballs. Each dish was flavorful and even our non-vegans friends had an enjoyable experience at this restaurant. The salads are also nicely seasoned. Would like to come back for their desserts next time. The place is quite cozy and intimate but perhaps not suitable for larger groups (6+ people) as it is hard to navigate between tables."
"We ordered 4 mains, 1 starter and 1 dessert. Everything was nicely done, tasty vegan fresh foods. Service was great, because we were told which one to avoid due to some restrictions (like alcohol and some herbs). We felt we were being taken care of‚Ä¶ truly appreciate the efforts. Almond milk taste in coffee lovely too. Price point for 4 pax was $176. To us it was alright because the portion is reasonably good. Will definitely recommend both vegan and non vegan to try."
"The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, perfect for a relaxing meal. The staff members were incredibly friendly and welcoming.  They took the time to give us detailed explanations of the dishes and provided us with their recommendations. Every dish we've tried was bursting with flavors even though its vegan. One dish that really stood out to me was the mushroom balls. Its packed with savory umami flavors and the texture is on point. The cauliflower steaks were also perfectly seasoned and had a delightful char that added a smoky depth to the dish. The friendly and attentive service combined with the incredible food made for a truly memorable dining experience."
"I have nothing against the place and I‚Äôm sure they put a lot of thought into their food but never again‚Ä¶. The kale chips were super salty, the kimchi roll too dry, and the watercress soup super strong. It was doable in small bites but we struggled to finish the food as it got simply overwhelming as we ate."
"This place is good for everyone - people on raw food and others. Everything is tasty and healthy ! Service is great and fast. This is my third time here. The kale dehydrated chips were tasty and crispy. The raw lasagna was delicious, and as a dessert the a√ßai bowl too was wonderful. My friends too loved the food, and the place."
"1. Afterglow Kimchi Avo Rolls - I disliked the taste entirely 2. Teriyaki Meatballs - the best 3. Tom Yum Zoodles - too spicy 4. Salted Eggless Sweet Potato Fries - good for the first few bites when it's hot. The Teriyaki meatballs were incredible. They were so good that they probably contributed to the other dishes seeming average. Nevertheless, for the steep asking price, I was expecting more flavor burst from the rest of the food. The restaurant was tiny and our table next to the counter felt cramped. All in all, I do not feel the need to go back to this restaurant."
"We came here for a team lunch and I was initially a bit worried as they were not the vegan loving bunch as much as I am. Surprisingly though, they all enjoyed the food, especially me and we were all so stuffed that we couldn‚Äôt order dessert tho I really wanted to ü•≤ü•≤ I really liked my almond milk latte too üòç"
"Have patronized Afterglow through the years and always admired their philosophy of healthy non-fried vegan food. This time round, we had the fish burger (upgraded our fries to salted egg potatoes), cheesy kale, and baked cheesy cauliflower. Tasty and filling. Worth keeping in mind that their food isn‚Äôt fried, so the texture of grilled or baked items are different. Service was very attentive, and we like the homely atmosphere and decor."
Had lasagnas (just a heads up it‚Äôs more raw and sold cold) needless to say was very balanced and delicious. Also had their cheesy cauliflower appetizer. It‚Äôs a must. I‚Äôm heading back tonight!
"I understand that this is a vegan restaurant but I‚Äôve really had better. we were very excited to try the sushi but it was honestly very hard to finish the dish - the rice was substituted with almond rice and it really destroyed the experience. we shared among the few of us, and none wanted to have the last piece. I‚Äôve had other vegan sushi‚Äôs but this rly pales in comparison, other diners probably appreciated this better since it was on almost every table - so try it at your own discretion. the dessert was top tier though, everything about it was amazing, not sure what it‚Äôs called but would highly recommend to get it."
"Great, well rounded dining experience. Food was wholesome and delicious. Staff was attentive, efficient and friendly. Thank you for the great experience. We will be back and will recommend this to all our friends"
"Our 1st time here. 1 of the owners did a detailed recommendation for me which we truly appreciate. Ambience is cosy. Food was served quite fast too! Tried the Teriyaki ‚ÄòMeat‚Äô balls (Fav side!), hummus of the day and Spiced Fvsh Burger with sweet potato covered with salted egg sauce! (MUST TRY the sweet potato with salted egg sauce!) Awesome restaurant for vegans!"
"The cafe is located within walking distance from Outram Park MRT. We made a reservation in advance to avoid unnecessary waiting queue. Kudos to the waiters which were very friendly and accommodating. We ordered a main and 3 sharing plates for 2 pax. At first, we were a little worried that we could not finish the food as the table was too small to place all the dishes. The smoked stack burger and cheesy cauliflower bites were great and we didn't expect vegan food could be served in such a unique way. I would highly recommend their must-try dish Teriyaki meatballs! However, the Kimchi Avo Roll was not to our liking. All in all, we had a great experience dining at a vegan cafe."
Been here many years back. Healthy vegan menu. Open till late. Good for dinners but limited menu for main.
"A cosy restaurant with very clear vegan/ vegetarian options and bespoke dishes that are not mainstream. For example, you get non alcoholic beer options here as well. The staff is relatively friendly and responsive. The food was good as well. The Taco Duo was quite good and had a very unique taste. The burger we ordered was also very good. I was a tad disappointed by their signature kimchi avo rolls. It tasted like it was pre-made, not freshly made after ordering, and the kimchi thus had an odour to it. Again, a unique taste nonetheless and different option for you to try from regular sushi rolls found everywhere."
Nice vegan restaurant which offers fusion cooking. I would recommend some of the mains and sides which are nice. 1) Teriyaki meat balls 2) Tom Yum zoodles 3) Cauliflower Steak Limited seatings and limited carparking facilities available. Do reserve a place in advance.
"If you think that Vegetarian food is bland and consists of leaves and mock meat, you are in for a surprise here. The food here is packed with lots of natural flavours and natural ingredients‚Äìlisting the ingredients on this takes me lots of time already‚Äìto bring out the meaty taste from the plants. A meal here makes both the body (healthy food) and tummy (yummy food) happy. The place is very hip, rustic, nostalgic with light Bohemian influences. And the food is very hearty and tends more towards the taste of Mexican food. Kimchi Avo Rolls is different from the sushi we know because it is made with almond sushi ""rice"". kimchi topped with avocado, sesame seeds and chilli flakes. This is like crunchy sushi with a multitude of very simulating flavours. I enjoy savouring this a lot. It's a hearty treat that teases the palates. But this is super filling, it's more like a mains than appetiser. Best to share this if you are also ordering something else on the mains menu. The Veggie Patty of Smoked Stack Burger is made from 11 natural ingredients! Such as broccoli, green beans, shitake mushrooms, beetroot, corn, celery, capsicum and more. Surprisingly, it tastes pretty meaty. It's a good burger. Just that the veggie patty not as firm as the usual meat patty, but the taste can match up to it. The sweet potato fries taste nice but it is not of the crispy texture that I would have preferred. So if you like crispy fries, you can let the staff know that you don't want this add-on. Chocolate Salted 'Caramel' Fudge is made from avocado mousse, salted tahini 'caramel', medjool date, walnut crust, agave syrup and cold-pressed organic coconut oil. Lots of ingredients, and it tastes interesting. The super sticky texture of the fudge and the hard crust is though not the texture I like in my dessert. I love Number 1 Junbucha. This is Kombucha with peach apple, sultanas, rose, marigold, strawberry leaves. Great for the guts and with minimal sugar. The best part is the sweetness is developed when drinking this with the food. I love the ambience of this quaint little restaurant. It's full of little touches that appeal to the side of me that craves for nature, peace and forward-thinking lifestyle. On a side note, this place is perfect for solo diners or those who want a go at it because there are so many of us dining here. Service is pretty good and friendly. The staffs also make the effort to confirm if the walk-in patrons have any allergy. Thoughts: Veggies can taste super good too!"
"The place was nice, and the staff very helpful. They did warn us about the fact that it was a vegan restaurant, and everything was meatless. My partner and I were okay. Therefore, review would be through the lens of quality of food. The food was good, for the Burger, it was really well seasoned. The Salted Eggless Sweet Potato fries was a nice touch and was worth upgrading for the burger. Improvements: - The Avocado Sushi was good, however, the Cauliflower rice tasted a tad sour and smelled a little bit. - The burger was really really tiny, and I can‚Äôt imagine someone getting full from it. - The Lentil Nuggets was crispy on the outside, and too soft on the inside. Which led me to think that it was indeed overcooked on the outside and not cooked enough outside. I have visited a few vegan restaurants before, but afterglow is not on my list to visit in the future. Again, through the lens of food quality."
"food is very innovative and impressive. i would say that it is a very good introduction into vegan food for non-vegans! the raw crispy lasagne was really good. refreshing vegetables, sweet tangy salad dressing. the best part is the cashew cream. the sauce drizzled on the lasagne was to die for. the cashew cream was tangy and full of umami, mimicking the taste of normal ranch and cheese sauces. the spiced fvsh burger was also amazing, the texture and seasoning lending so much flavour and mouthfeel that it really mimics a traditional fish fillet. seating was a little cramp for 2 seater tables but ambience was really chill and good for quiet, laid-back conversations. highly recommend."
They make vegan food both interesting and flavorful. We have been back multiple times despite being meat eaters. Only suggestion is to dial back the spiciness of the tom yum noodles and spicy burger.
"Excellent food in great location, quite cozy in there too, might have been biased by the stormy rainy weather outside. It is pricey, but not necessarily more than similar places in Singapore. I ate a shared platter, but on my own, don't recommend as you eat a lot of the same stuff, so i didn't end up liking it too much halfway through (I had more than enough of the cauliflower). The salad looks very simple but it tastes delicious, with a secret sauce included :P. Very sweet waiter, was allowed to stay until late, good wifi, had a call in there too :)"
"Interesting vegan restaurant. Made their own vegan dishes in house. Had several dishes. Burger with pumpkin fries was good , platter shown was good too"
"Booked an early dinner at 5:30pm on a Saturday here, inside was pretty filled with diners then..
The waitress was very helpful in explaining the different types of kombuchas to us and provided little shot glasses so that we could share the 2 bottles we ordered to try among the 5 of us. The cauliflower dish was delicious! Couldn‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs vegan, the ‚Äúcheese‚Äù was so creamy.. The spinach hummus dip was nice though I enjoyed it much more with the homemade tortilla chips than with the raw veg of carrots and jicama (turnip/bang kuang)
Fun and tasty food experience overall :) we liked that this place doesn‚Äôt use Impossible Meat or Beyond Meat, but real vegetarian food.. Tip: Bought the appropriate amount of Chope vouchers after getting the final bill so received some discount from there.. also street parking can be tough to find, can try the HDB carpark at Pinnacle@Duxton and take a 5 minute walk across to Keong Saik"
"24 Jun 23 Revisiting after 3 years. Great service. 3 tables incl us coccupied at a Friday lunch. We ordered - dessicated kale chips (5/5) - FVSH burger in bun (5/5) with no egg salted egg yolk fries and salad on side - cauliflower bites with salad with mango dressing We found the fries and cauliflower bites soft and limp. We learnt that they are baked not fried and hence don‚Äôt have a crispy crust. Taste was good but texture wasn‚Äôt great for us, sorry. Otherwise we enjoyed the service and atmosphere. Original review 3 years back 5/5 Third visit in two months... and counting! At lunch time on weekdays the crowd was thin, but don‚Äôt come without making a booking at nights/weekends. Although as an Asian Singaporean, I at first baulked at the idea of cold raw food, I am so glad the reviews won me over, and I had given Afterglow a try. You just cannot guess what to expect so just come and try. Each time I‚Äôve come with different people, we have had the Zucchini Linguine with ‚Äúmeatball‚Äù. A pleaser! And I‚Äôve tried the Cuban burger, the avocado/kimchi rolls, and the special cheesecakes (blueberry/orange last night). ALL GOOD! They also have a menu of hot and cold drinks, with or without alcohol."
"Quite pricey. The menu is made entirely whole-food plant-based, including raw vegan dishes and keto-friendly options. Alliums are clearly indicated. The Kimchi Avocado Rolls and Spicy Asian Zoodles I had were good. Burgers weren't impressive, and the Raw Vegan Mango Cheesecake was extremely disappointing (I've eaten quite a few raw vegan cheesecakes). Would probably recommend getting Zerah Patisserie's (non-raw) vegan tarts instead, only available on Fridays and Saturdays!"
"Tasty vegetarian food, 'fish' burger with sweet potato fries was good, generous portion sizes. Staff are really polite and pleasant!"
"Been to Afterglow over the years and finally writing a review. I must say the service has been consistently very good. The staff regularly shows to be well-informed with what goes into each dish and are always polite and attentive. Food is really good though pricey, but then again it's difficult to get cheap and nice vegan food. My non-vegan friends have remarked that they could eat vegan food if it tastes like this all the time haha! Also I remembered that in the past the menu used to have honey which to me wasn't vegan and I'm glad to see that it's no longer on the menu. I love their starters and would highly recommend the meatballs. Their meatballs have been recognised as one of the top vegan dishes in Singapore and rightly deserves it. They have nice desserts especially the tartlets (which I didn't see anymore not sure whether it's a limited time thing. I've posted the photo (ignore the pandan cake, it's not from here)). I would also recommend to make reservations before going as the place do not have many seats and can get really crowded."
"Love the ambience and atmosphere of this restaurant. Loved dinning at this place. We ordered riceless sushi rolls, fisheless lettuce buns, raw zucchini lasagne, teriyaki mushroom balls and raw chocolate dessert. We enjoyed the mains the dessert was not our liking. Overall I highly recommend this place, and will come back here to try other dishes on their menu."
"Our favorite vegan place in Singapore. The food is amazing and the owner was extremely kind and friendly. Drinks and everything we tried was delicious. Tom yum zoodels, avo roll, burgers, nuggets, mushrooms meatballs- was all fantastic. Thanks for a lovely experience ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"My family and i thoroughly enjoyed the food, ambience and service at the Afterglow restaurant. Smallish and cosy, the menu is filled with only vegan dishes, many of which are pretty innovative. Service was super where even the water served was infused with lemon. That ask you about any allergies before taking your orders. Must-go vegan restaurant."
Lovely and delicious food. And also vegan friendly! Good vibes!
"If only I could put 6 stars... The food at this place is amazing. I have rarely eaten so surprising and tasty dishes for a so decent price. All was just perfect: beverages, main dishes, desserts, coffee. Cheers!"
"Tom Yum Zoodles was really amazing - finished every bit of it. Kyoto Summer salad was really good too. However, the Afterglow Kimchi Avo Roll which is made of almonds instead of rice was too much almonds to handle. Overall still recommended for a clean meal :)"
"I quite enjoyed the unique meals from here. The meatball entree was truly exceptional, probably the best thing I've had from Singapore, a must have for sure. The patty from the spiced fvsh burger was an interesting experience, hard to tell apart from the brown rice patties I replaced the burger buns with! Healthier than your usual fare, and pricier. This place also has really clear allergen labels, even by Singapore standards!"
"I love this place for its fresh food and different menu. The cauliflower is a favourite, especially with the pumpkin paste. The Japanese salad is excellent. The noodles made of zucchini is very tasty. The fish burger was really spicy. All in all, thumbs up."
"The ambiance is so cosy and relaxing. The staff was so helpful and warm in assisting us. The #Vegan Smoked Burger üçî is made from wholesome and fine ingredients that are so tasty and flavourful. And it was surprisingly very filling! The Tom Yum Zoodles was very refreshing as the noodles were made from a whole plant, instead of your simple noodles! Amazing. My family had a great time dinning here. #AlliumFree #OptionsAvaliable #YummyForMyTummy"
"Chic & cozy cafe located in the midst of Tanjong Pagar / Outram Park area. Had a good time at this vegan cafe on my birthday. We had a brunch here and tried quite a few items including their Zucchini doodles, Avocado sushi, Teriyaki veg balls and oats milk latte. Location : Cafe is conveniently located in bustling CBD vicinity and can be easily accessed via public transportation or cabs. Parking space is available near outram park mrt. Ambiance : It has a warm wooden feeling to the ambiance. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. Food : Vegan food which is freshly prepared and is quite tasty as well. Service : Staff was very courteous and were serving well to the needs of all customers. Overall : overall it was a good experience. Would definitely visit this cafe if i am in the vicinity."
Afterglow a pure vegan restaurant a Hidden gem of a place at Keong Saik Road. Wonderful ambience. Great customer service. Small and cosy place. innovative menu. Yummy food. They even asked about allergies when taking order. Plain water is served with touch of lime squeeze. Love them all! Highly recommended! Must go restaurant for vegan food!
"First few times eating at a vegan restaurant, must say it‚Äôs quite an experience Tried a few dishes and would recommend the mac and ‚Äúcheese‚Äù, zucchini linguine and lagsana. Also had the quinoa burger but it was too dry. Overall the service was great but the portions were small and the meal was expensive. Non-vegans/ vegetarians may not appreciate this restaurant much."
"Good portion for the price. I really enjoyed the patty, marinade and the fries but did not enjoy the rice bun. It was too hard (it was almost like chewing uncooked rice). Not sure if it was meant to be that way but I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the coarse texture. I would get this burger again but will stick with the normal bun for sure. Besides the rice bun, 9/10 for the flavour and presentation!"
Alright vegan food and service. Salad dressing was salty.
"Finally a vegan restaurant serving great food. Went to this restaurant with my partner and brought a bottle of wine as their wine selection was rather limited, corkage was $40. Ordered the Kimchi Avo Rolls, Mac and Cheese Cali Bites, Cuban Burger, Salted Egg Burger and the Raw Cheesecake. I love how they are inspiration of meat food and they taste great. As a vegan myself, I felt like the food items could be done at home. Most of the ingredients felt repetitive. For instance the cheese for the Cali Bites and the Salted Egg Burger were likely just to be nutritional yeast, except curry leaves were added to the ‚Äúsalted egg‚Äù. The sweet potato hash also came with every burger. Service was too fast as well. After we ordered, the starters and the mains came together."
"i would say, not many places can cook vegan dishes really delicious. they are one of them worth revisiting again. i just hope that they could make the latte art properly. kinda annoying to see such latte art being serve on the table. might as well don't do the latte art and just serve the proper mix of coffee. :) other than that, all is good."
"One of my favorite vegan restaurants in Singapore! Every dish is unique and delicious. I especially love the Avocado kimchi rolls, Hummus of the day and Cheese cakesüòç The portion is not big so it's good for sharing even for a small group. You might need to order more dishes to get full if you eat a lot like I do ;)"
"A hidden gem tucked away at Keong Saik serving healthy food. For $76, we ordered: 1. Avocado kimchi kimbab 2. Smokey burger 3. Salad 4. Chocolate miso cheesecake Overall, a must visit for those craving for a feel good meal. The highlight is definitely the avocado sushi, blew our minds away. The burger and salad were decent, while the chocolate miso cheesecake might raise eyebrows (acquired taste, perhaps). It‚Äôs a little pricey but worth the healthy goodness."
"Very good vegan food . The lentil nuggets, burger and kimchi shusi are the best ! We have been here for at least 3 times in 6 months ! We are glad that we found a place that we can visit multiple times. Ans I don‚Äôt have to worry about traces of dairy and meat . Feels good for the environment as well. People working there are friendly . Quiet , is a good place to talk . It is located at a very nice neighborhood . Next to Chinatown ."
"Cosy place with delicious food! Service staff was very friendly, she offered recommendations and explained the off menu items too. Ordered the kimchi avo roll and the tomato risotto (seasonal menu) - both were extremely flavourful and rich, but have a fresh feel so we didn‚Äôt have to worry about being gelat. We also tried the Apple praline tart which was a pleasant surprise - the sweetness of the thinly-sliced apples really complimented the roasted hazelnut flavour. Will definitely be back for more! Also water is complementary and staff were consistently efficient at filling the glasses up :)"
"Nice cofy place, very good service. First time trying all full vegan food."
"We are not really fans of vegan food but we had better tasting ones than these. The outlook, ambience and environment is 5 stars. But the taste is lower than the quality of the food. We ordered quite a number of dishes and only the lasagne, 'scallops' and soup had taste. The nuggets were so dry, the sweet potato didn't tasted sweet, the burgers were overly spiced and the orange almond coffee was so sour... We don't even know how should we recommend or not recommend this place. All I can say is, don't visit on an empty stomach."
"It is my first time having vegan, raw, keto food and I did appreciate my time here. If you‚Äôre looking for keto food, do ask the service staff to point it out to you. Do note that the zucchini spicy noodles is cold so your tummy will be all cold from it which some may not appreciate. Overall, the price point is definitely high but a good joint to try out"
