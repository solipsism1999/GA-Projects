"Had a very attentive server explaining the ingredients behind the dishes. The menu is well marked for common allergens such as nuts, gluten, alliums, etc. We absolutely loved the vegan meatballs. Each dish was flavorful and even our non-vegans friends had an enjoyable experience at this restaurant. The salads are also nicely seasoned. Would like to come back for their desserts next time. The place is quite cozy and intimate but perhaps not suitable for larger groups (6+ people) as it is hard to navigate between tables."
"We ordered 4 mains, 1 starter and 1 dessert. Everything was nicely done, tasty vegan fresh foods. Service was great, because we were told which one to avoid due to some restrictions (like alcohol and some herbs). We felt we were being taken care of‚Ä¶ truly appreciate the efforts. Almond milk taste in coffee lovely too. Price point for 4 pax was $176. To us it was alright because the portion is reasonably good. Will definitely recommend both vegan and non vegan to try."
"The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, perfect for a relaxing meal. The staff members were incredibly friendly and welcoming.  They took the time to give us detailed explanations of the dishes and provided us with their recommendations. Every dish we've tried was bursting with flavors even though its vegan. One dish that really stood out to me was the mushroom balls. Its packed with savory umami flavors and the texture is on point. The cauliflower steaks were also perfectly seasoned and had a delightful char that added a smoky depth to the dish. The friendly and attentive service combined with the incredible food made for a truly memorable dining experience."
"I have nothing against the place and I‚Äôm sure they put a lot of thought into their food but never again‚Ä¶. The kale chips were super salty, the kimchi roll too dry, and the watercress soup super strong. It was doable in small bites but we struggled to finish the food as it got simply overwhelming as we ate."
"This place is good for everyone - people on raw food and others. Everything is tasty and healthy ! Service is great and fast. This is my third time here. The kale dehydrated chips were tasty and crispy. The raw lasagna was delicious, and as a dessert the a√ßai bowl too was wonderful. My friends too loved the food, and the place."
"1. Afterglow Kimchi Avo Rolls - I disliked the taste entirely 2. Teriyaki Meatballs - the best 3. Tom Yum Zoodles - too spicy 4. Salted Eggless Sweet Potato Fries - good for the first few bites when it's hot. The Teriyaki meatballs were incredible. They were so good that they probably contributed to the other dishes seeming average. Nevertheless, for the steep asking price, I was expecting more flavor burst from the rest of the food. The restaurant was tiny and our table next to the counter felt cramped. All in all, I do not feel the need to go back to this restaurant."
"We came here for a team lunch and I was initially a bit worried as they were not the vegan loving bunch as much as I am. Surprisingly though, they all enjoyed the food, especially me and we were all so stuffed that we couldn‚Äôt order dessert tho I really wanted to ü•≤ü•≤ I really liked my almond milk latte too üòç"
"Have patronized Afterglow through the years and always admired their philosophy of healthy non-fried vegan food. This time round, we had the fish burger (upgraded our fries to salted egg potatoes), cheesy kale, and baked cheesy cauliflower. Tasty and filling. Worth keeping in mind that their food isn‚Äôt fried, so the texture of grilled or baked items are different. Service was very attentive, and we like the homely atmosphere and decor."
Had lasagnas (just a heads up it‚Äôs more raw and sold cold) needless to say was very balanced and delicious. Also had their cheesy cauliflower appetizer. It‚Äôs a must. I‚Äôm heading back tonight!
"I understand that this is a vegan restaurant but I‚Äôve really had better. we were very excited to try the sushi but it was honestly very hard to finish the dish - the rice was substituted with almond rice and it really destroyed the experience. we shared among the few of us, and none wanted to have the last piece. I‚Äôve had other vegan sushi‚Äôs but this rly pales in comparison, other diners probably appreciated this better since it was on almost every table - so try it at your own discretion. the dessert was top tier though, everything about it was amazing, not sure what it‚Äôs called but would highly recommend to get it."
"Great, well rounded dining experience. Food was wholesome and delicious. Staff was attentive, efficient and friendly. Thank you for the great experience. We will be back and will recommend this to all our friends"
"Our 1st time here. 1 of the owners did a detailed recommendation for me which we truly appreciate. Ambience is cosy. Food was served quite fast too! Tried the Teriyaki ‚ÄòMeat‚Äô balls (Fav side!), hummus of the day and Spiced Fvsh Burger with sweet potato covered with salted egg sauce! (MUST TRY the sweet potato with salted egg sauce!) Awesome restaurant for vegans!"
"The cafe is located within walking distance from Outram Park MRT. We made a reservation in advance to avoid unnecessary waiting queue. Kudos to the waiters which were very friendly and accommodating. We ordered a main and 3 sharing plates for 2 pax. At first, we were a little worried that we could not finish the food as the table was too small to place all the dishes. The smoked stack burger and cheesy cauliflower bites were great and we didn't expect vegan food could be served in such a unique way. I would highly recommend their must-try dish Teriyaki meatballs! However, the Kimchi Avo Roll was not to our liking. All in all, we had a great experience dining at a vegan cafe."
Been here many years back. Healthy vegan menu. Open till late. Good for dinners but limited menu for main.
"A cosy restaurant with very clear vegan/ vegetarian options and bespoke dishes that are not mainstream. For example, you get non alcoholic beer options here as well. The staff is relatively friendly and responsive. The food was good as well. The Taco Duo was quite good and had a very unique taste. The burger we ordered was also very good. I was a tad disappointed by their signature kimchi avo rolls. It tasted like it was pre-made, not freshly made after ordering, and the kimchi thus had an odour to it. Again, a unique taste nonetheless and different option for you to try from regular sushi rolls found everywhere."
Nice vegan restaurant which offers fusion cooking. I would recommend some of the mains and sides which are nice. 1) Teriyaki meat balls 2) Tom Yum zoodles 3) Cauliflower Steak Limited seatings and limited carparking facilities available. Do reserve a place in advance.
"If you think that Vegetarian food is bland and consists of leaves and mock meat, you are in for a surprise here. The food here is packed with lots of natural flavours and natural ingredients‚Äìlisting the ingredients on this takes me lots of time already‚Äìto bring out the meaty taste from the plants. A meal here makes both the body (healthy food) and tummy (yummy food) happy. The place is very hip, rustic, nostalgic with light Bohemian influences. And the food is very hearty and tends more towards the taste of Mexican food. Kimchi Avo Rolls is different from the sushi we know because it is made with almond sushi ""rice"". kimchi topped with avocado, sesame seeds and chilli flakes. This is like crunchy sushi with a multitude of very simulating flavours. I enjoy savouring this a lot. It's a hearty treat that teases the palates. But this is super filling, it's more like a mains than appetiser. Best to share this if you are also ordering something else on the mains menu. The Veggie Patty of Smoked Stack Burger is made from 11 natural ingredients! Such as broccoli, green beans, shitake mushrooms, beetroot, corn, celery, capsicum and more. Surprisingly, it tastes pretty meaty. It's a good burger. Just that the veggie patty not as firm as the usual meat patty, but the taste can match up to it. The sweet potato fries taste nice but it is not of the crispy texture that I would have preferred. So if you like crispy fries, you can let the staff know that you don't want this add-on. Chocolate Salted 'Caramel' Fudge is made from avocado mousse, salted tahini 'caramel', medjool date, walnut crust, agave syrup and cold-pressed organic coconut oil. Lots of ingredients, and it tastes interesting. The super sticky texture of the fudge and the hard crust is though not the texture I like in my dessert. I love Number 1 Junbucha. This is Kombucha with peach apple, sultanas, rose, marigold, strawberry leaves. Great for the guts and with minimal sugar. The best part is the sweetness is developed when drinking this with the food. I love the ambience of this quaint little restaurant. It's full of little touches that appeal to the side of me that craves for nature, peace and forward-thinking lifestyle. On a side note, this place is perfect for solo diners or those who want a go at it because there are so many of us dining here. Service is pretty good and friendly. The staffs also make the effort to confirm if the walk-in patrons have any allergy. Thoughts: Veggies can taste super good too!"
"The place was nice, and the staff very helpful. They did warn us about the fact that it was a vegan restaurant, and everything was meatless. My partner and I were okay. Therefore, review would be through the lens of quality of food. The food was good, for the Burger, it was really well seasoned. The Salted Eggless Sweet Potato fries was a nice touch and was worth upgrading for the burger. Improvements: - The Avocado Sushi was good, however, the Cauliflower rice tasted a tad sour and smelled a little bit. - The burger was really really tiny, and I can‚Äôt imagine someone getting full from it. - The Lentil Nuggets was crispy on the outside, and too soft on the inside. Which led me to think that it was indeed overcooked on the outside and not cooked enough outside. I have visited a few vegan restaurants before, but afterglow is not on my list to visit in the future. Again, through the lens of food quality."
"food is very innovative and impressive. i would say that it is a very good introduction into vegan food for non-vegans! the raw crispy lasagne was really good. refreshing vegetables, sweet tangy salad dressing. the best part is the cashew cream. the sauce drizzled on the lasagne was to die for. the cashew cream was tangy and full of umami, mimicking the taste of normal ranch and cheese sauces. the spiced fvsh burger was also amazing, the texture and seasoning lending so much flavour and mouthfeel that it really mimics a traditional fish fillet. seating was a little cramp for 2 seater tables but ambience was really chill and good for quiet, laid-back conversations. highly recommend."
They make vegan food both interesting and flavorful. We have been back multiple times despite being meat eaters. Only suggestion is to dial back the spiciness of the tom yum noodles and spicy burger.
