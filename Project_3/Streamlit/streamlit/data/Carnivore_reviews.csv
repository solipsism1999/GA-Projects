"This is a meat lovers paradise! Every meat they serve is awesome! My faves are the rump cap, chicken thigh and the butterfish! But on the whole food is awesome, and service is great! I especially loved the service from an elderly gentleman. He was attentive to my needs and made sure I got what I wanted. He deserves 100 stars and he makes my day!"
"Meats were a bit dried but taste still not that bad, salad bar and dessert okay, overall okay"
"Felt like meat variety for rotation was alot lesser than what was shown on their website. Pineapples only came twice, of which once did not even made it to our table."
For all meatlovers. so many different meat to choose from. a lot side dishes and dessert. Delicious!
For the experience. Meat isnt the best quality. But for price of buffet it is worth it. Nice enough to provide complimentary cake for bday
"It was a nice place with a selection of meat options and some salads and sides. The food was good, especially the beef cuts. The service was so so, there was minimal service and were slow to refill the plates. I didn't like the time limit of 90 minutes because of this. I felt rushed and couldn't enjoy the food as much as I wanted. But overall, it was a decent experience and I would recommend it if you like meat and don't mind the time limit."
"The salad bar had a relatively good variety of options. Food quality is good, only that the beef brisket was slightly on the saltier side. All the servers are friendly and attentive. It was a good experience, really enjoyable."
"For meat lovers And I think I am, but just can't consume so much. The restaurant has limited indoor seats. Thought we sat outside, it still comfortable. Thanks to the nice weather. Many choices of meat, perfect cooking. The counter has ready food such as salad and soup. Also some fruits and cake as dessert at another counter, this need improvement, too little choice."
"I used to go to Carnivore at HarbourFront a long time ago. Have always been a fan of this restaurant! The meats are so wonderful, so juicy and tender.. marination is perfect too! The salad bar, mashed potatoes and sauces were also really good. All the staff were so polite and friendly! Especially the 2 female Service staff who were very helpful, hardworking and professional even though they’re quite young. I’d give you 10 stars if I could!"
Celebrated a nice dinner with good ambience for our wedding anniversary. Mr Guan was very nice and attentive to our needs. And he even surprised us with an anniversary cake which was quite delicious. Overall delightful with all the wonderful staffs.
"My first experience eating at a Brazilian Steakhouse. Great place to have your salted bbq meats, very attentive staff and the dinner service was great! Meat portions were also very generous. One can expect to spend about $135++ for two persons including two simple iced teas. Do be mindful that this is a straight up meat place hence they serve quite a lot of beef. The beef was grilled to perfection! Pineapple came last to help with digestion."
"A case of buyer beware! We were given no menu and therefore no information on prices etc. The idea seems to be that steak is carved for you at the table from a skewer. After an initial enthusiastic offering when about three slivers of steak were provided to each of us, the server returned with another joint from which further slivers were carved. It was clear that more slices of steak would not be entertained and no more was offered following the initial foray. As we reluctantly paid our SG$243 for what was clearly a joke, other diners were being offered sausages and other delights. We were not amused."
"Good variety of meat available. But there are times when certain cuts of the beef only appear once throughout the entire buffet. Things like chicken wings and sausage keeps appearing. At this price, they should be consistent with the variety. Whenever a cut of beef is served and I asked for X amount of slices, I always get shortchanged. Also, they should include plain water with the buffet. Big room for improvement."
"Sorry to write this, but we really did not have a good time at this place. The location of the restaurant is very charming and unique, but the food is decent at most and the service is downright poor. The staff was very negligent and borderline rude, ignoring us, spilling the food on the table, etc. You can pick from many other restaurants around, so do yourself a favor and avoid this one EDIT: There is a response from the restaurant citing an experience with a party of 5. We were not a party of 5"
"the location is convenient at chjimes which is walkable from City Hall station. The service is good as the staffs will bring around the freshly bbq meats! i love the butterfish a lot as it's so tender! They offer grilled chicken heart too, truly a surprise for me but really delicious!"
"Birthday treat Pros: 1. Beef brisket 2. Spicy pork 3. Pork belly 4. Chicken thigh 5. Chicken wrapped in bacon 6. Grilled pineapple 7. Dessert 8. Teriyaki chicken 9. Sides taste better than Keisuke's. Cons: 1. Need to pay for water. We got to pay $10 for some atas bottle 2. Homemade Sausage taste very bad 3. Beef rump, hump, has a lot of fat and taste tough"
"It's great, brings back memories. 10yrs ago at Vivocity, we were served with Salmon on large skew; that's so delicious & perfect. The serve staff are jovial and savvy. Love it there."
"Excellent restaurant for a date night. Amazing food, although not all were good hits. I would suggest to only have very small portions of any chicken meat. Everything else, totally worth it. Definitely a place worth going to for the experience. Price is acceptable for a one time affair."
"Love the Brazilian bbq buffet, pretty good."
The vegetables got wok hei sia! - definitely the highlight of the meal
