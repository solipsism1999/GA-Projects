"This is a meat lovers paradise! Every meat they serve is awesome! My faves are the rump cap, chicken thigh and the butterfish! But on the whole food is awesome, and service is great! I especially loved the service from an elderly gentleman. He was attentive to my needs and made sure I got what I wanted. He deserves 100 stars and he makes my day!"
"Meats were a bit dried but taste still not that bad, salad bar and dessert okay, overall okay"
"Felt like meat variety for rotation was alot lesser than what was shown on their website. Pineapples only came twice, of which once did not even made it to our table."
For all meatlovers. so many different meat to choose from. a lot side dishes and dessert. Delicious!
For the experience. Meat isnt the best quality. But for price of buffet it is worth it. Nice enough to provide complimentary cake for bday
"It was a nice place with a selection of meat options and some salads and sides. The food was good, especially the beef cuts. The service was so so, there was minimal service and were slow to refill the plates. I didn't like the time limit of 90 minutes because of this. I felt rushed and couldn't enjoy the food as much as I wanted. But overall, it was a decent experience and I would recommend it if you like meat and don't mind the time limit."
"The salad bar had a relatively good variety of options. Food quality is good, only that the beef brisket was slightly on the saltier side. All the servers are friendly and attentive. It was a good experience, really enjoyable."
"For meat lovers And I think I am, but just can't consume so much. The restaurant has limited indoor seats. Thought we sat outside, it still comfortable. Thanks to the nice weather. Many choices of meat, perfect cooking. The counter has ready food such as salad and soup. Also some fruits and cake as dessert at another counter, this need improvement, too little choice."
"I used to go to Carnivore at HarbourFront a long time ago. Have always been a fan of this restaurant! The meats are so wonderful, so juicy and tender.. marination is perfect too! The salad bar, mashed potatoes and sauces were also really good. All the staff were so polite and friendly! Especially the 2 female Service staff who were very helpful, hardworking and professional even though they’re quite young. I’d give you 10 stars if I could!"
Celebrated a nice dinner with good ambience for our wedding anniversary. Mr Guan was very nice and attentive to our needs. And he even surprised us with an anniversary cake which was quite delicious. Overall delightful with all the wonderful staffs.
"My first experience eating at a Brazilian Steakhouse. Great place to have your salted bbq meats, very attentive staff and the dinner service was great! Meat portions were also very generous. One can expect to spend about $135++ for two persons including two simple iced teas. Do be mindful that this is a straight up meat place hence they serve quite a lot of beef. The beef was grilled to perfection! Pineapple came last to help with digestion."
"A case of buyer beware! We were given no menu and therefore no information on prices etc. The idea seems to be that steak is carved for you at the table from a skewer. After an initial enthusiastic offering when about three slivers of steak were provided to each of us, the server returned with another joint from which further slivers were carved. It was clear that more slices of steak would not be entertained and no more was offered following the initial foray. As we reluctantly paid our SG$243 for what was clearly a joke, other diners were being offered sausages and other delights. We were not amused."
"Good variety of meat available. But there are times when certain cuts of the beef only appear once throughout the entire buffet. Things like chicken wings and sausage keeps appearing. At this price, they should be consistent with the variety. Whenever a cut of beef is served and I asked for X amount of slices, I always get shortchanged. Also, they should include plain water with the buffet. Big room for improvement."
"Sorry to write this, but we really did not have a good time at this place. The location of the restaurant is very charming and unique, but the food is decent at most and the service is downright poor. The staff was very negligent and borderline rude, ignoring us, spilling the food on the table, etc. You can pick from many other restaurants around, so do yourself a favor and avoid this one EDIT: There is a response from the restaurant citing an experience with a party of 5. We were not a party of 5"
"the location is convenient at chjimes which is walkable from City Hall station. The service is good as the staffs will bring around the freshly bbq meats! i love the butterfish a lot as it's so tender! They offer grilled chicken heart too, truly a surprise for me but really delicious!"
"Birthday treat Pros: 1. Beef brisket 2. Spicy pork 3. Pork belly 4. Chicken thigh 5. Chicken wrapped in bacon 6. Grilled pineapple 7. Dessert 8. Teriyaki chicken 9. Sides taste better than Keisuke's. Cons: 1. Need to pay for water. We got to pay $10 for some atas bottle 2. Homemade Sausage taste very bad 3. Beef rump, hump, has a lot of fat and taste tough"
"It's great, brings back memories. 10yrs ago at Vivocity, we were served with Salmon on large skew; that's so delicious & perfect. The serve staff are jovial and savvy. Love it there."
"Excellent restaurant for a date night. Amazing food, although not all were good hits. I would suggest to only have very small portions of any chicken meat. Everything else, totally worth it. Definitely a place worth going to for the experience. Price is acceptable for a one time affair."
"Love the Brazilian bbq buffet, pretty good."
The vegetables got wok hei sia! - definitely the highlight of the meal
The name says it all. Great for meat eaters! Range of stewer meat from fish to beef to mutton and chicken heart. Light serving of free flow salad bar with mini brownies and fruits Discount for safra members too
"We came to Carnivore as a family to have an early Mother’s Day dinner after several years. It was nice to see the staff being very friendly as we remembered, especially Guan who has always been very welcoming and attentive. Food was as good as remembered!!! Cheers to all."
Brazilian steak is very good. The meats are seasoned nicely and good selection to taste. Chimes is a beautiful setting for a nice get together and events.
"About SGD $75 per person for a meal with drinks here. Ambience at Carnivore Brazilian Churrascaria is relaxed and rustic. The simple, modern, wooden cushioned furniture is in shades of black and brown, contrasting with the simple bare walls and floors. There is minimal decor, but what little there is are homages to Brazil and its culture. Latin American music plays in the background, very apt with its lively salsa beats. The spacious layout and comfortable vibes lend well to long, lingering, communal meals with friends. Service at Carnivore Brazilian Churrascaria is friendly, courteous, and professional. Staff make an effort to go out of their way to accommodate requests, which I like. They display proper attention and care for diners, and have good product knowledge, able to describe the various options in the salad bar or on the menu. Staff also clear empty / dirty plates and tables efficiently. The knife wielding passadors are skilled, introducing each meat, then expertly carving it right in front of guests; with no mess and no splashback from gravy. Food at Carnivore Brazilian Churrascaria is all about Brazil style churrascaria. Begin the buffet at the salad bar, where over 15 different hot and cold dishes (salads, appetizers, soups, staples) await. The staff will then come around with large skewers of various cuts of meat, in total, 14 different cuts are available, comprising chicken, pork, fish, and the signature, beef. Generally, dishes are executed well, with consistent quality expected of a restaurant. Being a buffet, portions are free-flow. Prices are reasonable too, budget SGD $75 per person for a meal with drinks here. My favourite picks are (Not in Order): 1) Cogumelos Com Balsamico / Mushrooms With Balsamic Vinaigrette 2) Salsicha De Porco Picante / Spicy Pork Sausage 3) Galinha Envolvido / Bacon Chicken Wrapped In Bacon 4) Barriga De Porco Assado / Roast Pork Belly 5) Chimichurri Lombo / Chimichurri Beef Top Sirloin It’s a pity I did not get to try the Abacaxi Grelhado / Grilled Pineapple, as the guy disappeared. I might have missed out quite a few other tasty choices too."
"Food is pretty good and with the current covid crowd, you're most likely ensured to get the best cut. Meat selection wise seems to be leaning heavily towards beef, pretty good way to get your meat craving on."
"was just there to celebrate a birthday and the place is subpar to say the least. for a $600 price tag for 5 people ( with drinks), I don’t think we will ever go back again or recommend it to anyone. The meat selection was so limited even during dinner time. Also if you have a tall child, please be prepared to pay for them as an adult. per staff, they go by height not age."
They bring various tasty meats to you and sides are decent (you help self) I would say with a beer is about $100 each. Different if you don't want to stick to one meat or one steak. Their kitchen grill is interesting
"First time there and had a good time , uncle Paul was wonderful and is a true asset to the company. Uncle Paul really took care of all our Needs and was a great host even though the restaurant was busy , Thank you Uncle Paul . Just a request to the restaurant to label the meat as the meatballs were not and turned out to be beef."
"The food. Was absolutely phenomenal. All the meats were well seasoned, and when a more unusual meat is being offered, the chef serving will always preemptively inform you what it is, and whether you would like to have it. There was only 1 or 2 pieces of meat that were slightly dry. The serving chefs are also very pleasant to talk to, and sometimes make pleasantly cheeky remarks that adds to the atmosphere of the place. A sense of, homeyness, in a restaurant in a upmarket area. If i could tip them directly, i would. They definitely enhanced my experience. It has completely exceeded my expectations, especially in terms of service."
Very nice food and service
One of the best Brazilian grill restaurant in town. Atmosphere is fantastic and the meat is very well prepared! Advice: Go there with an empty stomach!
"Attentive service staff and a wide selection of meats. The food is not too salty, though I think the meat could be more thoroughly seasoned. They also have a decent selection of side dishes. Drinks are delicious. The outdoor dining area is well ventilated, and thus not too hot. Nice ambiance especially in the evening."
"As the name suggests, great for hearty meat eaters. It’s also fun to have the Passadors come around. They are so enthusiastic and friendly!"
Grilled meats are great but the sides are a bit less interesting. They do not provide free water and the price can be pretty steep on weekend nights.
"A great buffet place for meat lovers! I recommend the beef brisket, and the beef ribs."
"Didn’t get to snap pictures of all the meat that’s being served but I’d say the fish, chicken thigh, and beef was absolutely great!! The waiters were very attentive as well, and my friends and I had a great catch up over a meal. Would recommend the buffet on weekdays so you’d get the Happy Hour promo! 😱🙌🏻😁"
Perfect for meat lover and skewers fan. Lots of meat from chicken to beef to lamb. Limited indoor seats though. Free flow salad bar and hot dishes (the beef stew is good!). The kitchen crew will continuously serve you meat so no need to order anything or walk to the restaurant. Couldn't eat much though so didn't think my $69++ was worth.
"Very pleasant venue, good service and tasty meat, in good supply. Unfortunately the lunch variety of meats was lacking. A few different cuts of beef, 1 very salty ham they called pork, beef brisket which was more like corned beef. No lamb, or mutton, and chicken hearts only for poultry. I hear dinner has more variety but is of course almost twice as expensive. Still, I’ll be back for my meat fix!"
"Food quality is below average, only the beef rump is good, limited variety of sides, not sure about other outlet but this is my first experience with carnivore. Probably will not visit again. However, the 4 star review comes from the excellent service from a crew name Xaviera, I hope I got her name right, she is very attentive and polite."
Loved it. It's definitely one of the better churrascaria in town. There were no photos taken as I was busy with the eating. Haha.
"food was really good, service was fantastic! very interesting experience of having the entire skewer brought to your table and cut in front of you. but don't underestimate the portions, after a few (maybe 5-7 rounds?) of meat, you do get very full. they are very generous with their servings, each slice of meat can be cut thickly (or thinly if you want). favorites were the garlic beef, roasted pork and the cheese ball bread. honorable mention to the fish as it was super flavorful. their side dishes were not bad too! quite liked the mashed potatoes. everyone was really friendly and attentive as well. it was overall a truly great experience."
"Have always wanted to try this place. However I left thinking it was a nice experience but I would not be back. The meat was served very slowly. There was no butterfish, lamb and chicken with bacon and a few other dishes that was stated on their menu. Most items came round  to us only once and the restaurant was not full capacity."
"I love Brazilian food especially Churrascaria’s, however this was disappointing. Meat was really tough and we tried each one they brought over (beef sirloin, lamb, pork, short ribs, rump, chicken wrapped in bacon). The meat was not tasty at all and just really hard to chew and dry. Salad bar was okay, not huge and we skipped dessert. The two stars are really for the employees who were lovely and the outdoor atmosphere which was nice. Wouldn’t eat there again."
"Great service, great meats. Solid drinks!"
"Nice Christmas Day dinner here at Carnivore. It was raining hard and the manager was very kind and found a table inside for my pregnant wife to sit so that she wouldn't slip on the ground. That was very nice, thank you!"
"My partner came her for dinner on a Wednesday night made a reservation for 6pm. We arrived and the staff greeted us very warmly and showed us to our booth and explained how the process worked before allowing us to make our orders. The manager (not sure but he seemed to be) was very nice and spent a bit of time early in service talking to us about where we were from and even joked about my camera which I had brought along. The food was absolutely incredible and we helped ourselves to as much as we could stomach and it was all fantastic. I would highly recommend this place to meat lovers, and we will definitely be back the next time we are in Singapore."
Great place for quality meat! Do prepare for a heavy portion and thick cuts!!
"Bad food, little choices and not value for money. Service was bad too and havent finish our meal already keep asking to clear the plate. Never again"
"EDIT: We came here after our visit two years ago. At that time, we had a negative experience. Not this time. First of all, the sides at the salad bar, although it doesn't have many choices, were all well executed. I loved the meatballs, pasta and mussels especially. The star of the show is definitely the meat. All cuts of meat tasted hot, fresh and juicy with just the right doneness. They even had a special edition - beef cooked with stout for St Patrick's day. In our last visit, we did not have any pineapple. This time, we had so many pieces of pineapple slices, all perfectly charred. We definitely had a good dining experience. Only con is that they do not serve water and will ask you to buy those expensive still or speaking bottled water. I would definitely recommend anyone to visit Carnivore, if they want to experience a churrascaria here in Singapore. It is even more worth it with the 10% SAFRA discount. --------------------------------------------- I would not recommend coming here at all. We went on a weekday at 6pm sharp. We saw that there were only a few skewers of meat grilling in the kitchen area. We thought that they did not grill much as there were not much guests around. The rate of serving the meat was very slow in the beginning. As the evening progressed, the rate of serving the meat was still very slow. We did not even get the grilled pineapple, despite having requested it twice. All the waiters were standing around and they were not proactive at all in asking us what cuts do we want. if you want a better experience, you should go to the one at sixth avenue where it is much better hands down."
"Guan and his team delivered impeccable service and were a so kind, friendly, thoughtful and attentive. The food was fabulous, very fresh and just kept on coming until we were so full and could have no more. Thank you Guan and see you again soon!"
