Ground Venison with 10% Beef Fat‚Ä¶ Safe for Jerky?,1,16k9nq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/16k9nq4/ground_venison_with_10_beef_fat_safe_for_jerky/,1694876459.0,"I was planning to make a several pounds of (ground) deer jerky (using a jerky gun) to clear room in my freezer for the upcoming deer hunting season. I bought all the supplies (seasonings, cure, vacuum sealer bags, desiccant packs) and got everything in order so I could take care of it this weekend. 

When I took the ground deer meat from the freezer, I noticed that there was quite a bit of white in it. I had never even noticed it when using the meat in other recipes, so I went back and looked at the price list from the processor who did it. Their price list says that they add 10% beef fat to all ‚Äúdeer burger‚Äù, which is what I have. I have always been under the assumption that you‚Äôre supposed to have zero or very little fat in Jerky. I have searched online, and have found various different opinions and explanations. Some people report preferring as much as 10% fat in ground jerky, while others say that it is unsafe and will go rancid. I plan to make a semi-large quantity of finished product, and vacuum seal smaller packages with desiccant packs inside. Now I‚Äôm unsure of whether 10% fat is safe for long-term storage (<3 Months), even if it IS safe for immediate consumption. 

If it makes any difference, I am planning to dehydrate it in a regular, household, countertop, round, food dehydrator. I don‚Äôt have a smoker. Also, I was specifically planning to use the ground meat because I have a lot of it that is taking up space in my freezer. 

What is the consensus here? Can I use this (10% fat) meat for jerky? Would it be safe to eat, or should I just scrap my plans and do something different? Could I possibly grind some lean steaks to add to the ground meat to decrease the fat percentage?",meat

So it makes me wonder were these same technology used to preserve meats? How come in contrast to ice cream there seem to be not a lot of info regarding meat preservation using these stuff?

Additionally for primitives people who did not create empires and ther organized civilizations like the Innuits, they often took snow and icre they found outside in the wilderness and used them in strange but very cool ways to create frozen sweet foods, some alleged cases or even creating something resembling modern ice cream! So I also ask was meat preserved using ice and snow during cold weather? Again how come we don't hear much about this as a preservation method?",meat

That is essentially the same as just buying the pre-cut top sirloin or whatever is on sale for the day. In truth, I would expect to pay <$6.50/lb. Looking at USDA reported pricing for the region it should be about $6/lb.

Costco says they won't sell it to me, BJ's is $7.99/lb, Harris Teeter is $8/lb, sam's club is $8.50/lb. All of these are still in the cryo bag so there is no reason they should be much above their wholesale rate to me.

I was just wondering what is the deal with duck? Is it healthy? Tasty? Is it too fatty? To tough? People seem to not like duck. Just wondering if cooking a whole duck and trying it out is worth it. I am doing carnivore for health reasons. However, I really enjoy and make all of my meats ‚Äúmelt in your mouth, fall off the bone, tender‚Äù I‚Äôll even crisp it up and cook it till a bit burnt too. 

Is this possible with duck? 




I am mostly eating chicken. All pieces including skin, fat, kidney, liver. That I divide into portions and freeze. Then eat over the span of a month or 2. Also beef. Mostly certain cuts and steaks that I like. Then I usually have beef back ribs once a month which are delicious. I save the beef fat // tallow. 

I want to add in Lamb, sheep, and beef head. Lamb shoulder, leg, ribs. Also beef heart, liver, brain, and tripe. As well as turkey. I love turkey wings

Uncured Bacon,4,15s2juo,https://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/15s2juo/uncured_bacon/,1692128233.0,"Washington Post put up a good article on the myth of uncured bacon. It's paywalled so here's a copy/paste:

It‚Äôs reasonable enough to assume that ‚Äúuncured‚Äù bacon, with labels touting ‚Äúno nitrates or nitrites added,‚Äù would be a healthier choice. After all, nitrite and its chemical cousin nitrate in processed meats are probable carcinogens, according to the World Health Organization. If you have the opportunity to avoid them and still enjoy the foods you love, why not?

Unfortunately, when it comes to food labeling in the United States, things are not always what they seem. And in the case of bacon ‚Äî as well as other processed meats, such as cold cuts and hot dogs ‚Äî the labels ‚Äúcured‚Äù and ‚Äúuncured‚Äù can be pretty misleading.

Uncured bacon is akin to putting lipstick on a pig ‚Äî it‚Äôs still bacon. To understand why, let‚Äôs take a closer look at what‚Äôs shakin‚Äô when it comes to both cured and uncured bacon.

Cured vs. uncured bacon

The truth is there is little practical difference between cured and uncured bacon in terms of health. Both are cured in the true sense of the word, meaning they are preserved.

The use of the labels ‚Äúcured‚Äù and ‚Äúuncured‚Äù on processed meats results from Agriculture Department‚Äôs labeling regulations. To be called cured, the meat must be processed with synthetic nitrites or nitrates. (You‚Äôll see types of them, such as potassium nitrite or sodium nitrite, in the products‚Äô ingredient list.)

Without these compounds, meat would spoil. ‚ÄúNitrite is especially important because it has inhibitory action against microorganisms and specifically against spores of Clostridium botulinum [which cause botulism], should they be present,‚Äù says Jeff J. Sindelar, a meat science professor and extension meat specialist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

Nitrites and nitrates also can form from natural sources, such as celery salt, powder, or juice, and these can be used to cure meat. Because they aren‚Äôt synthetic, the Agriculture Department requires meat processed with them to be labeled ‚Äúuncured‚Äù and ‚Äúno nitrates or nitrites added.‚Äù

It‚Äôs a technical detail; the chemical composition of these curing agents are the same. ‚ÄúNitrite is nitrite, regardless of source,‚Äù Sindelar says.

And, as Consumer Reports‚Äô 2019 tests of deli meats found, ‚Äúuncured‚Äù meats contain similar amounts of nitrites and nitrates as ‚Äúcured‚Äù products.

‚ÄúWhen people see ‚Äòuncured‚Äô and ‚Äòno nitrates/nitrites added‚Äô on a label, they believe the meat is healthier,‚Äù says Amy Keating, a nutritionist at Consumer Reports. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs not the case.‚Äù Eliminating the confusing labeling rules would help.

In 2020, the Agriculture Department said it planned to propose prohibiting these two terms on meats that have been processed with any form of nitrates or nitrites, but it hasn‚Äôt yet done so.

What nitrates and nitrites do to your body

No matter the source, nitrites and nitrates have the same health effects, says Michael Hansen, a senior scientist at Consumer Reports. Broken down in your body in the presence of compounds found in proteins, they can form nitrosamines. Nitrosamines may increase the risk of certain types of cancer in humans, according to the National Cancer Institute. A 2021 review of 148 studies published in the European Journal of Epidemiology found that those who ate the most processed meat had an increased risk of breast, colon, rectal and lung cancers.

Cancer isn‚Äôt the only health concern when it comes to processed meat. In a 2020 review in the journal Diabetes & Metabolism, for every 50 grams ‚Äî about 2 ounces ‚Äî per day of processed meat intake daily, the risk of Type 2 diabetes went up by 46 percent.

Processed meat has been linked to heart disease, as well. Compared with eating none, those who ate about 5 ounces or more of processed meat per week had a 46 percent increased risk of heart attack or stroke in a study involving about 134,000 people in 21 countries published in 2021 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The study did not find a link between eating unprocessed red meat or poultry and heart problems, and the researchers noted that the preservatives and additives in processed meats may partly explain their different effects on health.

But if nitrosamines that form from celery are harmful, does this mean eating celery is harmful, too? No. Celery and some other veggies ‚Äî such as arugula, beets, and spinach ‚Äî do contain nitrates or nitrites. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs little protein in vegetables so their nitrates and nitrites don‚Äôt easily convert to nitrosamines,‚Äù Hansen says.

And the nitrites and nitrates in vegetables may actually be helpful. ‚ÄúPlant-based sources of nitrate, assisted by other vegetable components in these foods, such as vitamin C and polyphenols, serve as sources of nitric oxide production in the body,‚Äù says Norman Hord, professor and chair of the nutrition department at University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City. Nitric oxide production may help improve blood vessel health and blood pressure, and enhance muscle function.

‚ÄúCured or uncured, less is more when it comes to processed meats like bacon,‚Äù Keating says. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to give them up entirely, but they shouldn‚Äôt be a regular part of your diet.‚Äù",meat

We all have the same opinion. Store Bought meat is disgusting and does not taste the same as it used to. Especially with Beef.  
We all have grown up on home raised beef, pork, and chicken. We were all hunters and ate Venison and Elk regularly as well.  
But something in the last I'd say 3 years has really deteriorated store bought meat, it's revolting to me now. I cannot really explain it, but it just tastes dead. It's weird to describe but that is my best description: dead. If I buy a steak from a store, it is nearly impossible for me to eat it no matter how I cook it.  
It didn't use to be like this... All my life I could taste the difference between home raised and store bought. But store bought was not horrible.  Sure it was just less of quality but it wasn't vile...  
I have no clue what happened, but it does seem in the last few years something changed with store bought and it's repulsive to me now.  


Anyone else have this in their area?  
Or is it just us?  
Is there any new packaging or shelf life laws that passed to make this happen?

I know what your thinking, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a lot of fat‚Äù. This is a mangalitsa breed pig. It‚Äôs fat is monounsaturated, the only animal fat of its kind. Has 2-3 times more omega threes than fish. Is low in pro inflammatory omega 6. The fatty acid composition in mangalitsa pigs closely resembles breast milk. Mangalica fat is an important source of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which has been shown to affect body composition positively and has various other health benefits as well. 
It is is an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, such as different B vitamins, vitamin D, zinc, iron, phosphorus and magnesium. 


I hate grizzle on commodity meat. I can grill a block of this fat and eat it with bbq sauce. The ribs that came off of this were the best thing I‚Äôve ever eaten in my life hands down. Salt pepper and Carolina gold BBQ sauce. 

It‚Äôs from Mosefund.

The sauce is great, it tastes like it‚Äôs made of sweet and sour fruit, if I had to guess it would be orange and pineapple (the orange melon looking thing on the bottom right is pineapple). It‚Äôs more sweet than sour as the sourness is very subtle but offers just enough acidity to balance out the sweetness. What‚Äôs also amazing is the texture of beef. It‚Äôs almost ‚Äúbouncy‚Äù (??) or squishy, I don‚Äôt know how to call that. It‚Äôs very soft and juicy, but when you bite into it it‚Äôs almost elastic and will squish before under your teeth before you can bite into it. And although the name of the dish states fillet I‚Äôm very surprised as although fillet is usually tender, it generally lacks taste and juiciness imo, but this is both very tasty and juicy on top of being tender.",meat

Now that the nice weather is upon us I decided to crack it open and to try a pork butt I got on sale around Christmas.  I thawed it out for several days, patted it down, and applied a nice dry rub recipe I found online.  

I have a manual temperature smoker adjusted by a knob so it was a little difficult, but I was able to keep the smoker around 215 to 235¬∞.  My big issue seems to be that my water pan evaporated multiple times.  I smoked the pork butt for 15 hours at the above mentioned temperatures, and had to check it every couple of hours because the water kept evaporating.

The pork is pretty badly burned on the outside, though about 60% of it is relatively delicious.  

Does anyone have any idea or experience with their water pan completely evaporating, or needing very close monitoring?  A good friend of mine who smokes a lot of me and who recommended this smoker to my wife has never experienced anything like this and rarely checks his smoker during the cook time. 

 Should I have aimed for a much lower temperature?  All my friends seem to think this is a no-brainer cooking method but I keep screwing it up.",meat

& I used half the package a bit ago, and so the other half of it has been in my fridge in a zip lock baggy a bit longer than it should have (at least 1 week), I took it out and the outside looks kind of gray, I picked it a part and got all the gray off the outside, 

but here‚Äôs the kicker: it doesn‚Äôt smell bad. At *all*.    I know what rotten, or even starting to turn meat smells like, and this doesn‚Äôt even have a whiff of it. 

Long story short: I‚Äôm curious if it‚Äôs safe to eat. The gray could just be simple oxidation, but I didn‚Äôt know if maybe the different composition of the added heart and liver made it a bit more resistant to starting to grow or cultivate bad bacteria. 

Just wondering if anyone has more knowledge with this type of stuff. 

If I was going off smell alone, I would consider this 100% fine. 

It‚Äôs just the visual that‚Äôs throwing me off a bit.

Oven brisket,6,12bp6w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/12bp6w2/oven_brisket/,1680627444.0,"Hi all,

I am cooking two approx 6lb briskets, flat cut with pretty large fat cap. I have them sitting on top of and surrounded by potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic, and slathered in tomato paste and spices. I have cooked this recipe before, but this year I'm wondering about temperature and covering. 

My oven can go as low as 175 in convection roast (I haven't checked it with an independent thermometer). I understand that the ideal temperature for muscle and fat to tenderize and render is around 205. If I cook at 200 degrees, should I leave the brisket in for hours after it has an internal temperature around 200? Will it overcook, or just get better, as long as it can't get above that temperature due to the oven being held at 200? 

Also would like advice on covering or not. The brisket isn't sitting deep in liquid but there is some touching the bottom, which I can replenish as it evaporates. Or I can cover it and leave it alone longer. The original recipe has stages covered and uncovered which seems complicated. 

Thanks in advance for your ideas",meat

For how long can you safely marinate pork chops?,2,11yhxe7,https://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/11yhxe7/for_how_long_can_you_safely_marinate_pork_chops/,1679488886.0,"  Hi guys üòä 

I threw some high quality pork chops in a marinade (olive oil, dried herbs, lemon juice, dried spices, fresh garlic) last Sunday. As I had to visit my parents and I dined at a restaurant I haven‚Äôt been home and therefore I haven‚Äôt had the time to cook the meat. They have been marinated for around 72-76 hours now.

&#x200B;

So, my question is: Are the pork chops still safe to eat?

&#x200B;

(this is the only source I could find, which might answer the question: [https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/How-long-can-you-marinate-pork](https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/How-long-can-you-marinate-pork) )

&#x200B;

And before anyone comments, I will of course not eat them if they smell strange etc. :)",meat

The latter family owned company is the dominant grocery store chain in Texas by a huge margin over whoever is in second place. I'm guessing they get 80% of all grocery sales in Texas.  Their prices are great and they are good corporate citizens when disaster strikes.

Anyway, beef cheeks.  A package is kinda like a blob. They need ""low and slow"" to become tender.  Generally, crock pot cooking.  I've tried many variations such as in red wine, Chinese five spice, with chipotle peppers, and of course always, onions and garlic.  All recipes are great.  My next experiment will be to smoke on low heat.  Perhaps finish in the crock pot.

After proper cooking, you get an incredibly soft, easy to chew meat that has almost no fat!  Four ounces will give you  28 grams of protein with only 3 grams of fat!  That's something like 97% lean with lots of flavor, unlike 95% lean ground beef.

I guess most folks will have to ask their meat cutter or grocer about getting this.  I guaren-damn-tee you you won't be disappointed.",meat
