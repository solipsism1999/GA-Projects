I bought all the supplies (seasonings, cure, vacuum sealer bags, desiccant packs) and got everything in order so I could take care of it this weekend. 

When I took the ground deer meat from the freezer, I noticed that there was quite a bit of white in it. I had never even noticed it when using the meat in other recipes, so I went back and looked at the price list from the processor who did it. Their price list says that they add 10% beef fat to all ‚Äúdeer burger‚Äù, which is what I have. I have always been under the assumption that you‚Äôre supposed to have zero or very little fat in Jerky. I have searched online, and have found various different opinions and explanations. Some people report preferring as much as 10% fat in ground jerky, while others say that it is unsafe and will go rancid. I plan to make a semi-large quantity of finished product, and vacuum seal smaller packages with desiccant packs inside. Now I‚Äôm unsure of whether 10% fat is safe for long-term storage (<3 Months), even if it IS safe for immediate consumption. 

If it makes any difference, I am planning to dehydrate it in a regular, household, countertop, round, food dehydrator. I don‚Äôt have a smoker. Also, I was specifically planning to use the ground meat because I have a lot of it that is taking up space in my freezer.

Qeustion #6 really pisses me off.  You have to buy a ""value pack"" ($45+) of 2 ribeyes from the loin end just to get 2 steaks from the ""Large End"" (ribs 6-7-8),  You can't buy singles of 6-7-8.  That's fucked up.  Now we KNOW they do that on purpose.

Uncured Bacon,6,15s2juo,https://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/15s2juo/uncured_bacon/,1692128233.0,"Washington Post put up a good article on the myth of uncured bacon. It's paywalled so here's a copy/paste:

It‚Äôs reasonable enough to assume that ‚Äúuncured‚Äù bacon, with labels touting ‚Äúno nitrates or nitrites added,‚Äù would be a healthier choice. After all, nitrite and its chemical cousin nitrate in processed meats are probable carcinogens, according to the World Health Organization. If you have the opportunity to avoid them and still enjoy the foods you love, why not?

Unfortunately, when it comes to food labeling in the United States, things are not always what they seem. And in the case of bacon ‚Äî as well as other processed meats, such as cold cuts and hot dogs ‚Äî the labels ‚Äúcured‚Äù and ‚Äúuncured‚Äù can be pretty misleading.

Uncured bacon is akin to putting lipstick on a pig ‚Äî it‚Äôs still bacon. To understand why, let‚Äôs take a closer look at what‚Äôs shakin‚Äô when it comes to both cured and uncured bacon.

Cured vs. uncured bacon

The truth is there is little practical difference between cured and uncured bacon in terms of health. Both are cured in the true sense of the word, meaning they are preserved.

The use of the labels ‚Äúcured‚Äù and ‚Äúuncured‚Äù on processed meats results from Agriculture Department‚Äôs labeling regulations. To be called cured, the meat must be processed with synthetic nitrites or nitrates. (You‚Äôll see types of them, such as potassium nitrite or sodium nitrite, in the products‚Äô ingredient list.)

Without these compounds, meat would spoil. ‚ÄúNitrite is especially important because it has inhibitory action against microorganisms and specifically against spores of Clostridium botulinum [which cause botulism], should they be present,‚Äù says Jeff J. Sindelar, a meat science professor and extension meat specialist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

Nitrites and nitrates also can form from natural sources, such as celery salt, powder, or juice, and these can be used to cure meat. Because they aren‚Äôt synthetic, the Agriculture Department requires meat processed with them to be labeled ‚Äúuncured‚Äù and ‚Äúno nitrates or nitrites added.‚Äù

It‚Äôs a technical detail; the chemical composition of these curing agents are the same. ‚ÄúNitrite is nitrite, regardless of source,‚Äù Sindelar says.

And, as Consumer Reports‚Äô 2019 tests of deli meats found, ‚Äúuncured‚Äù meats contain similar amounts of nitrites and nitrates as ‚Äúcured‚Äù products.

‚ÄúWhen people see ‚Äòuncured‚Äô and ‚Äòno nitrates/nitrites added‚Äô on a label, they believe the meat is healthier,‚Äù says Amy Keating, a nutritionist at Consumer Reports. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs not the case.‚Äù Eliminating the confusing labeling rules would help.

In 2020, the Agriculture Department said it planned to propose prohibiting these two terms on meats that have been processed with any form of nitrates or nitrites, but it hasn‚Äôt yet done so.

What nitrates and nitrites do to your body

No matter the source, nitrites and nitrates have the same health effects, says Michael Hansen, a senior scientist at Consumer Reports. Broken down in your body in the presence of compounds found in proteins, they can form nitrosamines. Nitrosamines may increase the risk of certain types of cancer in humans, according to the National Cancer Institute. A 2021 review of 148 studies published in the European Journal of Epidemiology found that those who ate the most processed meat had an increased risk of breast, colon, rectal and lung cancers.

Cancer isn‚Äôt the only health concern when it comes to processed meat. In a 2020 review in the journal Diabetes & Metabolism, for every 50 grams ‚Äî about 2 ounces ‚Äî per day of processed meat intake daily, the risk of Type 2 diabetes went up by 46 percent.

Processed meat has been linked to heart disease, as well. Compared with eating none, those who ate about 5 ounces or more of processed meat per week had a 46 percent increased risk of heart attack or stroke in a study involving about 134,000 people in 21 countries published in 2021 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The study did not find a link between eating unprocessed red meat or poultry and heart problems, and the researchers noted that the preservatives and additives in processed meats may partly explain their different effects on health.

But if nitrosamines that form from celery are harmful, does this mean eating celery is harmful, too? No. Celery and some other veggies ‚Äî such as arugula, beets, and spinach ‚Äî do contain nitrates or nitrites. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs little protein in vegetables so their nitrates and nitrites don‚Äôt easily convert to nitrosamines,‚Äù Hansen says.

And the nitrites and nitrates in vegetables may actually be helpful. ‚ÄúPlant-based sources of nitrate, assisted by other vegetable components in these foods, such as vitamin C and polyphenols, serve as sources of nitric oxide production in the body,‚Äù says Norman Hord, professor and chair of the nutrition department at University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City. Nitric oxide production may help improve blood vessel health and blood pressure, and enhance muscle function.

‚ÄúCured or uncured, less is more when it comes to processed meats like bacon,‚Äù Keating says. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to give them up entirely, but they shouldn‚Äôt be a regular part of your diet.‚Äù",meat

3. For the short ribs, are spare ribs or Square cut flanken the same thing as short ribs?

We all have the same opinion. Store Bought meat is disgusting and does not taste the same as it used to. Especially with Beef.  
We all have grown up on home raised beef, pork, and chicken. We were all hunters and ate Venison and Elk regularly as well.  
But something in the last I'd say 3 years has really deteriorated store bought meat, it's revolting to me now. I cannot really explain it, but it just tastes dead. It's weird to describe but that is my best description: dead. If I buy a steak from a store, it is nearly impossible for me to eat it no matter how I cook it.  
It didn't use to be like this... All my life I could taste the difference between home raised and store bought. But store bought was not horrible.  Sure it was just less of quality but it wasn't vile...  
I have no clue what happened, but it does seem in the last few years something changed with store bought and it's repulsive to me now.  


Anyone else have this in their area?  
Or is it just us?  
Is there any new packaging or shelf life laws that passed to make this happen?

I know what your thinking, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a lot of fat‚Äù. This is a mangalitsa breed pig. It‚Äôs fat is monounsaturated, the only animal fat of its kind. Has 2-3 times more omega threes than fish. Is low in pro inflammatory omega 6. The fatty acid composition in mangalitsa pigs closely resembles breast milk. Mangalica fat is an important source of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which has been shown to affect body composition positively and has various other health benefits as well. 
It is is an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, such as different B vitamins, vitamin D, zinc, iron, phosphorus and magnesium. 


I hate grizzle on commodity meat. I can grill a block of this fat and eat it with bbq sauce. The ribs that came off of this were the best thing I‚Äôve ever eaten in my life hands down. Salt pepper and Carolina gold BBQ sauce. 

It‚Äôs from Mosefund.

And now that I think about it, it does seem odd how the sell by date was two weeks beyond when I bought it. (This was the 1lb organic ground beef from ALDIs that‚Äôs they have like 50 of them, packaged in commercial packaging, rather than the butcher style with styrofoam and plastic wrap.)",meat

Help with smoker,3,13gj5t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/13gj5t2/help_with_smoker/,1683988418.0,"My family got me a smoker for my birthday last year, I've only used it a few times because I'm very unfamiliar.  Now that the nice weather is upon us I decided to crack it open and to try a pork butt I got on sale around Christmas.  I thawed it out for several days, patted it down, and applied a nice dry rub recipe I found online.  

I have a manual temperature smoker adjusted by a knob so it was a little difficult, but I was able to keep the smoker around 215 to 235¬∞.  My big issue seems to be that my water pan evaporated multiple times.  I smoked the pork butt for 15 hours at the above mentioned temperatures, and had to check it every couple of hours because the water kept evaporating.

The pork is pretty badly burned on the outside, though about 60% of it is relatively delicious.  

Does anyone have any idea or experience with their water pan completely evaporating, or needing very close monitoring?  A good friend of mine who smokes a lot of me and who recommended this smoker to my wife has never experienced anything like this and rarely checks his smoker during the cook time. 

 Should I have aimed for a much lower temperature?  All my friends seem to think this is a no-brainer cooking method but I keep screwing it up.",meat

& I used half the package a bit ago, and so the other half of it has been in my fridge in a zip lock baggy a bit longer than it should have (at least 1 week), I took it out and the outside looks kind of gray, I picked it a part and got all the gray off the outside, 

but here‚Äôs the kicker: it doesn‚Äôt smell bad. At *all*.    I know what rotten, or even starting to turn meat smells like, and this doesn‚Äôt even have a whiff of it. 

Long story short: I‚Äôm curious if it‚Äôs safe to eat. The gray could just be simple oxidation, but I didn‚Äôt know if maybe the different composition of the added heart and liver made it a bit more resistant to starting to grow or cultivate bad bacteria. 

Just wondering if anyone has more knowledge with this type of stuff. 

If I was going off smell alone, I would consider this 100% fine. 

It‚Äôs just the visual that‚Äôs throwing me off a bit.

Oven brisket,5,12bp6w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/12bp6w2/oven_brisket/,1680627444.0,"Hi all,

I am cooking two approx 6lb briskets, flat cut with pretty large fat cap. I have them sitting on top of and surrounded by potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic, and slathered in tomato paste and spices. I have cooked this recipe before, but this year I'm wondering about temperature and covering. 

My oven can go as low as 175 in convection roast (I haven't checked it with an independent thermometer). I understand that the ideal temperature for muscle and fat to tenderize and render is around 205. If I cook at 200 degrees, should I leave the brisket in for hours after it has an internal temperature around 200? Will it overcook, or just get better, as long as it can't get above that temperature due to the oven being held at 200? 

Also would like advice on covering or not. The brisket isn't sitting deep in liquid but there is some touching the bottom, which I can replenish as it evaporates. Or I can cover it and leave it alone longer. The original recipe has stages covered and uncovered which seems complicated. 

Thanks in advance for your ideas",meat

The hidden gem of cheap, tender beef",101,11ud61c,https://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/11ud61c/beef_cheeks_the_hidden_gem_of_cheap_tender_beef/,1679110150.0,"I've never seen beef cheeks anywhere in my life except in my local HEB store.  The latter family owned company is the dominant grocery store chain in Texas by a huge margin over whoever is in second place. I'm guessing they get 80% of all grocery sales in Texas.  Their prices are great and they are good corporate citizens when disaster strikes.

Anyway, beef cheeks.  A package is kinda like a blob. They need ""low and slow"" to become tender.  Generally, crock pot cooking.  I've tried many variations such as in red wine, Chinese five spice, with chipotle peppers, and of course always, onions and garlic.  All recipes are great.  My next experiment will be to smoke on low heat.  Perhaps finish in the crock pot.

After proper cooking, you get an incredibly soft, easy to chew meat that has almost no fat!  Four ounces will give you  28 grams of protein with only 3 grams of fat!  That's something like 97% lean with lots of flavor, unlike 95% lean ground beef.

I guess most folks will have to ask their meat cutter or grocer about getting this.  I guaren-damn-tee you you won't be disappointed.",meat

Everyone in my family is well aware of my veganism 

My family are carnists, the type of people who put butter even in vegetables. My dad exclusively drinks tea or coffee with whole milk or just glasses of milk. He refuses to eat vegan anything. So I've been cooking all my own food with my own groceries while I've been here. 3 days ago I batch made faux spicy chicken pasta using fake chicken, jalape√±os, mixed peppers, spicy vegan mayo (mixed it with hot sauce) and spinach. Had it for dinner a few nights in a row with some steamed broccoli. For whatever reason it was giving me stomach discomfort but I figured it was the heat and just took an antacid and wondered if I was getting old. 

Well, this morning my dad proudly told me he had mixed leftover pieces of real chicken into my meal the night I made it and I hadn't noticed... I feel extremely betrayed beyond words. Apparently he did this out of concern that I wasn't getting enough protein and that me only eating broccoli with it every night only justified him more. 

I threw out the pasta and am packing to leave. Just need some comfort I guess. I feel gross",vegan

The day before I made a vegan pasta and had leftovers that I packed in the fridge. I went to school and then work so I was pretty much gone the whole day and then I came back home to find my roommates bf in the kitchen eating fried chicken that he ordered from takeout. My roommate wasn‚Äôt home yet. So I went into the fridge and couldn‚Äôt find my pasta. I asked him if he‚Äôs seen it (or you know, ate it) and then he started to apologize, saying he thought the pasta was his gfs and so he went to eat it, which already made me upset. But then he said he didn‚Äôt eat it all and tossed it because it was tofu? He said he realized it was mine when he started eating it (he knows I‚Äôm vegan).

Idk what it was whether it was the fact that he ate my food, that he threw it away, that he subtly kinda dissed the vegan pasta or the fact that bc he was hungry still he ordered fried chicken as an alternative and was eating it in my kitchen but it really pissed me off. Normally I don‚Äôt care if ppl eat non vegan foods in my place but idk at that moment the smell of the chicken was just nauseating. Idek what to say at that point and just went to my room and closed the door and cried lol

My roommate found out after and apologized and reamed out her bf and got him to apologize again but idk it really bothered me.

I woke up this morning and I‚Äôm still bothered. Am I wrong to be this upset?

EDIT: he offered to buy me dinner tonight but I declined I said it‚Äôs fine. I kinda just wanna move past this. He‚Äôs still here for a few more days.

EDIT2: Bc ppl are asking I didn‚Äôt accept the dinner bc my roommate was working late tonight and I didn‚Äôt wanna just have dinner with the bf by myself. I told him dw abt it (and tbh I feel better having vented here and seeing *mostly* supportive comments)",vegan

Norway has the worlds highest Human Development Index, so this is fitting for them.

‚ÄúBut if vegans can be annoying, they are also profoundly right. They are burdened with advocating for billions of suffering creatures and being able to help only a few. They are burdened with the futile, enraging task of trying to get people to live by their own articulated values.

i was at school (year 11) for music class and we have this performance next week so we went to check out the venue. me and three others were sitting outside by these two man-carved rocks and we were looking at this very tiny jumping spider. someone we‚Äôll call ‚ÄúM‚Äù was taking photos of the spider while i was holding him, he was very cute and harmless. the girl we‚Äôll call ‚ÄúN‚Äù was about thirty feet away. the three of my friends and i went to sit down at the benches that were there and i was still looking at the spider from a short distance. N walks up to the spider because she heard us talking about it and then proceeded to kick the spider about six times. the spider was dead within the first kick and she kicked multiple times to add insult to injury. i got mad, obviously, and i was in complete shock. i was shocked mainly because 1. we were OUTDOORS, theres gonna be spiders 2. it was tiny and harmless, it was a jumping spider 3. she was so far away from it, she took the time to walk over to it and kill it in the most violent way. i said to her ‚Äúwhy the fuck would you do that? that was completely pointless! he was a spider minding his own business and you killed it? why? why the fuck would you do that?‚Äù and her only response was ‚Äúall spiders deserve to die‚Äù with a smile on her face. i tried so hard not to lose my shit or show emotion, i said i needed a minute and walked behind the building. i couldnt stop myself from crying, my friends comforted me. fast forward to when were back at school, about an hour later, sitting down listening to my teacher talk. i still have a massive headache after what just happened at the theatre so im holding my head while sitting on a chair. i watch as N grabs a marker, walks to the whiteboard and writes ‚Äúall spiders deserve to be DEAD!‚Äù. she turns around, looks at me and smiles and then walks back to her keyboard. after she added MORE insult to injury i broke down again and left the room. i couldnt stop crying. the only reason she did that was to make me upset. my teacher phrased it as ‚Äúbullying‚Äù, which i absolutely agreed with.

none of my friends are vegan but they completely agree that it was unnecessary and to qoute them ‚Äúsociopathic‚Äù. ive felt like shit all day about this. mind you, N is 20 STILL going to a high school and bullying a 16 year old so that says something. my teacher said its okay because shes autistic. did i overreact? :( anyways thanks for reading.",vegan

people and activists gathered in fron of the sanctuary to keep the executors out of its perimeter, but after weeks of pacific defence the police decided to show up and use force to enter. the activists were hit with clubs, some of them were left injured on the ground.
the same happened with other activists inside the sanctuary.
the pigs who were still alive in spit of the ASF were killed, as well as the ones who were still healthy.
all of this just to protect lunches and dinners of all those people who still eat animal products.
there were negotiations in act to try to at least protect the animals that were still healthy and a court date was set but they didn't wait for it (we don't know why yet).
of course most newspapers and tv shows won't cover the news, all we have for now it's Instagram's lives and videos from the people who were resisting outside the sanctuary.
we really need help to spread the news outside of our own social medias cause it's the first time something like this happen and it could become a terrible example for future alike cases.",vegan

Productive but unsettling Reddit conversation I had with a non-vegan. Curious about others' thoughts.,4,16ohhu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16ohhu4/productive_but_unsettling_reddit_conversation_i/,1695306843.0,"I recently spoke with a non-vegan over on r/debateavegan and we got pretty far into a discussion before we decided to call it quits. I was uncomfortable in what I learned from this individual as they defended their non-vegan position. I'm curious what others here might think about it, or how you might proceed beyond the end-point that I reached with them.

**Their claims**

Eventually, I think I boiled down this person's position to them not valuing their own future existence (sort of nihilistic). Based on our points back and forth, I gathered that this person *would* agree that the unnecessary suffering an individual experiences is bad, and they could know this by extrapolating from their own subjective experience.

However, after a few hypothetical questions trimmed away unnecessary distractors, this person eventually settled on 1) if they were not afraid/affected of their imminent demise ahead of the fact; and 2) other individuals who still existed were unaffected; that, 3) they would not be opposed to their existence being suddenly taken from them. 

I confirmed that they (claim to) see no ethical quandry with their own existence being taken away from them under those stipulations. I checked to ensure that they considered the fact that this would needlessly take away their future and possibly good existence (something like a net loss of good), and that it was not their own will to have things ended. Yup no problem there, they said.

**what...**

After we got to that point, we wrapped it up. I felt that I had gleaned an important difference between our ethical foundations. I imagine that if we are to ever pick the conversation back up, they would be able to internally consistently claim that they feel justified in instantly ending the existence of animals with no ethical concerns, because they personally see *no problem* with their existence being wiped if other individuals are unaffected. Somewhat narcissistically, I assume they only care about others' continued existence when they personally know them. And... they would say the same for their loved ones in the hypothetical situation of sudden annihilation.

I think that is a sad foundation to build an ethical framework, and imagine that most people actually do care about being able to exist for as long as is possibly good to do so. Maybe this person does not truly believe what they claimed though they did not seem disingenuous. If they were genuine, what would you say after this point?",vegan

If someday the consumers tend to buy more vegan stuff they will eventually stop producing animal products.

When it comes to fast food chains, I'm torn about supporting them - even when I'm ONLY going for their plant based offerings.

On one hand, it feels like I'm indirectly endorsing their non-vegan practices.

On the other side, the demand for their plant-based items is a nudge in the right direction, pushing them towards more ethical food options on the menu.

I am leaning towards it encouraging change, rather than being contradictory. As by that logic, I‚Äôd have to shop in a purely vegan supermarket or eat at a purely vegan restaurant at all times.

I think of hope it would effect social lives for example, I go to Nando‚Äôs with non vegan family and friends, McDonald‚Äôs, bar burrito, Zizi‚Äôs, Pizza Hut, KFC etc. Do I go back to eating before I go out with those people? And only drink water when I‚Äôm at the establishment? I used to do that when there were no vegan options available - but it seems so counterintuitive now.

I was at an event at a local gay bar recently and they were raising money for a local gay sports club with a sausage sizzle but they didn't have any vegan options. I was surprised, because the venue is located in a part of my city which is something of a vegan hub. The staff explained that it was because the venue isn't large enough to have two barbecues and would thus be unable to prevent ""cross contamination"".

I was really disappointed and ended up having to go hungry until I got home later. Fine, it happens. But I wonder, how much is this something that vegans are really concerned with? What even is ""cross contamination""? My veganism has always been an ethical stance about animal liberation, not a disgust reaction to meat itself, and certainly not a health thing, so why should I be concerned about ""cross contamination"" anyway? It feels like something a ""vegan for my health"" type person would really be concerned with, rather than someone who is vegan for ethical reasons. Curious to hear peoples' thoughts.",vegan

Within the first week, I dropped a few pounds and noticed my belly was shrinking. I was like, hell yeah! Meats and cheese and milk must have been causing this belly fat. I‚Äôve been weighing myself pretty much daily since I started. 

Today I woke up and weighed myself and I‚Äôm at 127lbs. I haven‚Äôt weighed this little since high school. My belly fat is pretty much obsolete. 

I‚Äôm curious if this seems like an unhealthy weight loss progression. Losing ~10lbs in three weeks seems like a lot for my body type. And I don‚Äôt feel that I should lose much more than this.

I sometimes wonder if **all** the claims we make are actually backed by scientific evidence or if they're beliefs or arguments we use to convince others (or ourselves). I've come across various articles supporting different viewpoints, but I'm curious if there are assertions we employ without sufficient evidence. Are there arguments from vegans that you've encountered, that lack proof? Perhaps there are claims we rely on without substantial proof. Do you think there might be bias in some of the claims we present as it happens in potential biases in some non-vegan articles?

For instance, I've read claims from some vegans suggesting that carnists receive their B12 vitamin from supplements given on the farm to livestock. So taking B12 vitamin is just like a *shortcut*. However, I have yet to come across concrete evidence supporting this claim.

Maybe there are and it's just me that have not encountered! I'm just curious if you encountered some that you are for sure there is no sufficient evidence but we use them because we **believe** it is that way.

I live in France and I'm looking to stick stickers on the walls of my school.

The thing is, once I stick it up on the wall, I can't really take it back off. I want people's first impressions to be as good as possible, so I waited to think of the best thing instead of putting something up earlier.

So far, the best thing I've thought of is putting ""Avant de juger les veganes, regardez √ßa..."" (In English, ""Before judging vegans, watch this..."") and then having a QR code to a French version of Dominion below. I think this can be pretty effective since it warns people that it's about veganism so they don't instantly click off when they see vegan content, but at the same time it acknowledges the negative reputation that veganism already has.

Is this good? What can I put that you think will be the most effective?

I was also thinking that linking the full documentary would probably have very little people watch until the end. Should I put a shorter version on the documentary? Or maybe a different video entirely? I really want to choose the approach that'll get most people to be vegan.

"called ""selfish"" for not wanting to witness slaughter without saving anyone?",55,16n3ch6,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16n3ch6/called_selfish_for_not_wanting_to_witness/,1695159798.0,"Hey all! Feeling small after I had this interaction and I'm looking for feedback.

I'm a longtime animal rights activist. I've been vegan since I was 17 (now 23) and ever since I've been participating in demos like Cubes of Truth, volunteering, and events. I was the president of my college's vegan club, fought for vegan options in my dining hall while I was there, interned at animal sanctuaries and nonprofit orgs, and more. I also work for a huge animal rights nonprofit, not an organization that focuses on companion animals only, but one that seeks liberation for all.

I'm in contact with my state's Animal Save Movement founder about an event taking place soon. Chickens are slaughtered near my area annually for the purpose of a religious ceremony. It's my understanding that activists who interact with those taking part are kind, and encourage those participating to use an alternative to animals while preserving the purpose of the ceremony. It's also my understanding that *there is an animal-free way to go about this practice, but it is a preference to use chickens*. I'm not religious, so if anyone knows better than me about the practice I'm talking about, please chime in. My point here is that I take no issue with any particular religious group and I was interested in this event because it seems that the activists want the highest good for both the animals and the humans involved.

My contact posted the time and location of the event with vague info about it--essentially ""bearing witness"" was all that was communicated. The info about the event I listed prior was only received after I asked them directly about it. I was told by this contact that this event, although it would be an event intended to witness what the animals go through, would present an opportunity to rescue some animals. This was the appeal of it to me--a chance to make a difference for at least one animal.

I have depression and PTSD. I've been to dark places mentally thinking about the gravity of animal ag, and I know that watching animals die would lead to emotional torment. I decided to reach out to my contact because of this to let them know that I'm curious if the amount of activists present will affect the amount of chickens saved. If my presence at the event could help to save someone from slaughter, I'd be willing to see the abuse the chickens go through if I could make that sort of difference. But if the amount of chickens meant to be spared is set already through pre-existing negotiations, or my presence otherwise will have no effect on the amount of animals whose lives are spared, I feel worried about going to an event that will have such implications on my mental health if something positive won't come of it.

My contact replied that I was ""selfish"", that simply being there will make a difference for the chickens, and that they (my contact) have ""no time"" for my ""nonsense."" The way that I phrased my concern to them was respectful, and I was transparent about having mental health issues. They also did not indicate in their response whether the amount of people there will make a difference in the amount of chickens saved. I feel that they handled my question poorly, and if I was someone else who cared more about my relationship with them than I did about helping animals, I'd have chosen not to come already solely because of how they communicated with me. I also feel that if my presence will not lead to any more animals being saved, the chickens I encounter probably wouldn't care if one extra person is there to look at them die and feel pity. 

**Can bearing witness at an event be a positive thing for the animals involved, even if attending will not lead to animals being saved?** Am I being inconsiderate for (what I feel is) communicating my limits/boundaries, and stating that I want to make sure my presence is effective if I'm going to come? I feel like some activists have a ""holier than thou"" energy about them, and I feel like I was exposed to that here. I want to make sure that I'm doing enough for animals.

It terrifies me to think of how much more it would cost with my current meal plan if I add 200-300 more cal for bulking.

we are building a website to help educate society about veganism ‚Äì and are looking for a professional¬†web designer / frontend developer with a passion for UX & design.

Following a novel approach to animal rights advocacy, the website will fill an important gap. It is already up and running but needs a¬†‚Äúcorporate identity‚Äù (incl. layout, color scheme, fonts, etc.) before it can be widely distributed.

Are you experienced in this field and interested in joining a vegan activism project? If so, contact me via private chat (with links to prior work, if possible). I'll be happy to introduce you to the project.

The website is a project of the heart for us. We are motivated by passion and ethical concerns. Currently, we cannot offer a salary to ourselves or to new supporters. What we can offer, however, is the opportunity to participate in a novel project with great potential for the vegan movement.

Cheers üíö",vegan

After dinner, my friend says it was made with chicken broth so I ask again- she says no meat.

My friend is confused, and asks if it was made with chicken broth and she switches up her story, fully admitting to it containing meat.

I don't know what to do about this at all. I've already eaten it. I havent eaten an animal in 11 years. What is there to do? I emailed the school, but even if they take action, it doesn't change the fact that I still ate meat. It really feels like they just ended my 11 year streak...

Update 9/19: I emailed the school and they had a talk with the kitchen this morning. Hopefully they will label dishes in future, and they are retraining the staff on food restrictions and allergies (for those curious, the staff were supposed to know that any product made from a dead animal (including broth) was considered meat / not vegan or vegetarian. They have a set of rules that staff are supposed to follow strictly about contamination and labeling ingredients, but it wasn't being taught to all staff). Additionally, someone had also complained recently about unlabeled cashew milk in smoothies- which could have potentially hospitalized them. They're fine, but jeez, proper labels are really important :(

Human-animal hybrids,0,16n82bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16n82bo/humananimal_hybrids/,1695172522.0,"I had this thought going on recently.

Since we enter into a new age when we can create human-animal hybrids, there's been a lot of fuss in bioethics over the last few years about the ethics of creating such beings.

And to put it lightly the arguments that professionals make against the creation of human-animal hybrids is something that is mildly infuriating for my vegan mind. 

If you read them, you'll quickly come to the conclusion that ""humans are special and we don't want to cross that boundary"". Especially, not to run into morally difficult questions regarding the treatment of human-animal hybrids.

And I wonder this: why this is a question in the first place on how we should treat human-animal hybrids?

What does it matter its genetic makeup if it's going be a living being who wants to live and not to suffer like every human and animal?

The reason this question is asked in bioethics and the answer is such as given, shows that there is some serious flaw in the agreed upon moral system of the human race of today. 

And the juicy part is that bioethicists realize this!

And since like most people aren't vegan, including most people who are into bioethics, their reason that we should avoid the creation of human-animal hybrids is really a reason not to face an uncomfortable reality.

They don't want to answer uncomfortable questions, that demand answers, which are naturally uncomfortable. 

Blissful ignorance, the status quo and its comfort zone. That's what bioethics in this issue is aimed to preserve. 

If anything, the existence of human-animal hybrids to the public eye, would butthurt a lot people so much (who are inherently anti-vegan) that the truthfulness of veganism would no longer be so unaccessible to most as it stands today due to the myth of human exceptionalism that is so pervasive throughout our global culture. 

In short, if human beings lose their ways of thinking about themselves in their human supremacist terms, they might want to extend the most basic principles of human morality over to other living beings to avoid a total moral-ethical breakdown in society. Becoming vegan would become a slightly uncomfortable ethical duty rather than a personal choice based on pity and love for the animals.

These are just some of my thoughts, don't take it as if i mean it to be gospel.

so, to keep things short: I'm vegetarian, but after watching the Dairy Is Scary video on youtube, I definetly want to go vegan. there are only two problems tho...

‚ô° alright, so here's the bigger issue: I've been wanting to go vegetarian since I was like 7 I think, but my parrents only allowed me to stop eating meat when I was 9-10.

it's a bother for them to buy vegetarian food, because they both work at stressfull jobs and doing the shopping with my diet in mind can be stressfull. my sibling is also basically a carnivore, so they have to make 2 dinners.

I don't want to be a burden for them, and they expressed the fact that I would have to do the shopping all by myself, and I'd probably need to cook for myself too in a year or two.

This is the type of relationship we have had for 10 years. It sounds annoying but it is what it is. We met in college and he has always been an avid debater who loves to debate me, his family, his friends. He is my best friend. I am not trying to force him and he is not just some random roommate. He‚Äôs very smart so his complete denial and bad arguments were surprising to me and upsetting, and I wanted to vent and see if I could find a good argument to bring back to him (because this is how we talk about things). We have both changed each others minds on many issues and it was by talking through it and laying out the facts and THEN stepping away. We argue our best points about the issues we care about. I didn‚Äôt think in a vegan sub people would be so quick to attack me for a relationship they know nothing about, telling me I need to get over myself and shut up or I'll ""lose a friend"". Not at all the case. And if you're focusing on the relationship and not his comments I assume you're not an ethical vegan. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

This is a tad long but I am not feeling great about sharing an apartment with this person right now.

My roommate and friend cares a lot about social issues. He is politically aware and very much a leftist and spends a lot of his time learning about what‚Äôs going on in the world. He is very (at least he says) pro body positivity, supports LGBTQ issues, BLM (obviously), climate change etc. he does act like he is the greatest social justice warrior of all time.

In regards to veganism, he seems to suddenly lose his intellect and starts saying things like ‚ÄúI have always eaten meat. I like meat. Me not eating meat will not change anything. You can‚Äôt change it on an individual level‚Äù ‚Äúanimals are not more important than people‚Äù as if we have to choose‚Ä¶? All because he wants to keep eating meat. ‚ÄúWell we can do it in a humane way‚Ä¶‚Äù HE WILL SAY ANYTHING to justify eating meat. 

‚ÄúThe abuse part is bad. I agree they should stop doing that.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOk so what about bugs then. Are you going to stop killing bugs‚Äù when I said we can‚Äôt just take life from other animals.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs natural to eat meat, humans have always done it, it‚Äôs how our brains got so big‚Äù

What upsets me is not his idea that he can‚Äôt personally change the world but the fact he seems to care so deeply and be so KNOWLEDGEABLE about every other possible issue and doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about this one. Even if you can‚Äôt personally make a huge difference, why do you WANT to eat animals? He doesn‚Äôt get that ‚Äúick‚Äù response, he genuinely enjoys the taste, and so he makes excuses for it. If human meat was given to him, and it supposedly ‚Äútasted really good‚Äù, he still wouldn‚Äôt eat it, is my point. 

The ‚Äúpeople act like animals are just as important as people‚Äù comments really get to me. 

I have known him for a decade. I talk to him all the time about this issue, animal sanctuaries I follow, I send him videos about it to educate him. I just never asked directly about his thoughts because he is going through a hard time, and I don‚Äôt want to press him about veganism, but the fact someone can be so informed and so aware of every single social issue and then revert to cave man speak with eating animals ‚Äúme like meat. Me have always eaten meat and always will‚Äù sends me into a rage and i don‚Äôt know how to stop being angry. Probably just move out? How can I live with this person? It is disturbing to me I have been sharing my thoughts for months with him and the whole time no lightbulb went off in his brain and he was just thinking ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care I will keep eating meat‚Äù while passionately arguing about anything else. 

I said ‚Äúhow do you care about all this other stuff and this doesn‚Äôt matter to you?‚Äù And he goes ‚Äúit does matter. I said I don‚Äôt like the abuse part‚Äù 

When the people you‚Äôd expect to care don‚Äôt it can feel like a very lonely fight

Rant: no food for me and a lecture at my Dad‚Äôs burial,510,16l8exx,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16l8exx/rant_no_food_for_me_and_a_lecture_at_my_dads/,1694975843.0,"A handful of years ago we had my Dad‚Äôs burial in a small town where he and my Mom bought plots.

I know how to bring my own food. So I did and ate it in the car from the cemetery to the reception. No big deal.

My Mom being the loving mother she is, with no prompt from me, asked the person in charge if they had anything for me to eat. They went and checked and there was nothing. I‚Äôm sitting next to my Mom and they came back to tell her they didn‚Äôt have anything. The lady proceeds to lecture me about how being vegan is wrong and how she grew up on a cattle farm and how that‚Äôs better. I had said nothing to her before this. I just stared at her. She finally just left the table. Even my uncles at the table (who think being vegan is silly) said how inappropriate that was.

Can someone explain to me what cruelty-free actually means?,19,16lt476,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16lt476/can_someone_explain_to_me_what_crueltyfree/,1695037056.0,"For context: I've been buying cruelty-free make up, skin care, hair care, etc before I went vegan several years ago. Apparently there weren't any vegan perfumes so I didn't use any and still don't. However, now that I'm a full grown adult and I'm going to start working soon in a serious job, I feel like I need one. Because of that I've been investigating and the only cruelty-free perfumes that are listed in crueltyfreekitty are not available in stores in my country and I'm not going to spend $100+ on something that I don't know if I like it smell.

Now here is what I don't understand: Five years ago I started buying cruelty-free products because it felt like the right thing to do and it took 0 effort. After I've read recently about the topic, I discovered that animal testing for beauty products it's illegal in Europe, where I am from, but brands are not cataloged as cruelty-free because they test in China where it's mandatory to do so. My question is: Do they test in China the products that they sell worldwide or do they test in China only the products that they are selling in China? If I buy a non cruelty-free product in Europe, has it been tested on animals or not?? If not, how is different to buy a non-tested product from a non-cruelty free brand from buying fruit in a supermarket that also sells meat? Or from buying a cotton sweater in a store that also sells wool sweaters?

For the record I'm not looking for you to tell me that it's ok to buy non cruelty-free and I'm not going to stop doing it either. I am just genuinely confused.",vegan

Me and my friend are vegan and are having an ongoing debate started by a waiter at a vegetarian restaurant we frequented yesterday. Great start with the amicable chap knowing all about our food requirements, as he was explaining the various dishes he said the bread contained a ""very small amount of egg and was delicious depending on how vegan we are"". This delivery was accompanied by a friendly conspiratorial wink. 
As you can see where this is heading, this triggered our current debate. After much back and forth my friend blithely claimed to be the virgin mary of veganism, leading me to bring up 3 instances in the last few weeks where the rules were bent. Now community, may I please ask for some assistance in ranking these 3 misdemeanours in order of severity:

1) Using a shampoo at an airbnb with yoghurt as one of the products.
2) Killing bugs on the windshield of a rental car
3) Eating at vegan restaurant and lying to the owner telling him we'll be back 

And finally to finish off with a fun fact that I've recently learnt: there are some extreme vegans who refuse to eat figs because early on in the maturing process some bugs crawl inside and die. Personally I'm nommin' their tasty goodness all day long. I would love to also hear about some of your own minor sins in the comments!

"Gatekeeping post, intention matters when it comes to veganism and you might not be vegan",69,16li8bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16li8bj/gatekeeping_post_intention_matters_when_it_comes/,1695000802.0,"There is a recent post about an individual who **willingly and intentionally** travels to remote areas of the world and consumes animal products wondering if that was vegan

There were lots of people saying that this individual was fine and they were still vegan, so based on that the people making those comments and voting for those comments are all non vegan since they are supporting intentional animal abuse

A common argument that carnists use is that animals do die in order for us to consume our plants

There is a difference between intentional and unemotional animal abuse, when i buy veggies at the store i am not intending to fund animal abuse, but i cant control how the farmers grow their produce, they could switch to hydroponic warehouse based systems in all the office buildings that are now empty due to WFH but again i dont have control over that

When i buy steak or dairy i am directly and intentionally paying for animal abuse cause i want animal products

If i buy a granola bar at the store but at home after a few bites i realize it has dairy, i stop consuming and toss it, my intention was not to consume dairy

If i intentionally travel to remote places of the world knowing there is a chance i wont find edible plants, i am intending to commit animal abuse

If i was flying to Paris and my plane crashed and i landed in a remote carnivore village in Africa then im excused if i consume animal products as i was not intending this

To me this is very simple and plain and common sense

If you disagree with this and want to call me a gatekeeper that is fine, i am against animal abuse and i have to be the animals voice, i dont falsely identify as something that i am not, if i decide to intentionally consume animal products or defend/ excuse another for intentionally consume animal products i am not vegan because veganism is not a diet

I am not the vegan police, i dont decide who is vegan and who isnt i simply go by the intention of the supposed vegan and call them non vegan if their actions are in favor of or defending of animal cruelty, veganism is pretty simple for the most part, you either abuse animals intentionally or you dont, you arent vegan until you stop and you can stop and become vegan anytime you want to become a kind and decent individual, we welcome you",vegan

"A lack of focus/concentration, very dull head feeling in left side of head, forgetfulness, and minor headfog from anxiety or a lack of Omega-3?",0,16mbgxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16mbgxl/a_lack_of_focusconcentration_very_dull_head/,1695081107.0,"I became fully vegan between the months of February to April this year after following a vegetarian diet for 5+ years. During my time as a vegetarian I never consumed Omega-3 supplements or Omega seeds, so the likelihood is I went 5+ years without Omega-3 apart from getting it in my eggs (which to be fair, I did have eggs consistently weekly) which would have been DHA Omega-3, which is beneficial and healthy - some might say essential - for the brain; even before being veggie, I grew up barely ever having fish as a kid, which means I likely never had crazy Omega-3 levels outside of eating meat and eggs anyway. Anyway, cut to now being on a vegan diet and all was fine until a few months to about August time where I started getting headaches, brain fog, and other minor cognitive problems such as me feeling like my memory and overall intellectual ability - which was once incredibly strong - was weaker than usual. The headaches aren't there anymore but I have a dull feeling in the left side of my head every now and then, but the cognitive problems are still there, unless I'm just hyperfocused on them and neurotic about it (I'm very health anxious and am basically a hypocondriac at this point). However, I'm confused what the cause could be, as I went to the doctors a few weeks back and he told me I'm just experiencing head pressure and as long as I get fresh air and exercise it will eventually stop: the headache did stop, but the cognitive problems are still there. As far as I know it isn't a serious health condition. He told me to come back if the problem persists or other problems arise, but I don't know what he would even tell me if I were to go and explain this all to him, because it's extremely hard to get a free blood test on the NHS for nutrient and mineral deficiencies. I take The Vegan Society's VEG1 multivitamin chewable tablets everyday which contain all the nutrients and minerals vegans conventionally get a lack of through food and drink intake, so my B12 and Vitamin D levels should be absolutely fine. Additionally, I drink a lot of fortified vegan milks and have plenty of nutritional yeast in my meals, so the B12 and other fortified nutrients like calcium are covered. I highly doubt I have a vitamin and mineral deficiency, because I've only been a vegan for a few months, and the most important nutrients like B12 and Iron are stored in the body for years until they have a chance of depleting, and of course the whole choline thing and other minor mineral deficiency possibilities are a big anti-vegan myth anyway. My vegan diet has generally been super healthy thus far. I even went to my local opticians recently (I have yearly checkups as I have an eye condition) and he told me all is fine with my eyesight, so that can't be causing head problems. Anyway, as for the vegan stuff, I've maintained a healthy whole foods vegan diet and have consumed the nutrients I need, often getting enough calories to not be feeling hungry in the evenings. This makes me think - due to recent events in my life involving a lot of stress and anxiety - that my anxiety has finally gotten the better of me and that's perhaps created a temporary head and brain problem where I'm not up to scratch with cognitive ability like my usual self would be. 

That being said, although I've maintained a nutritious vegan diet, the one thing I've not consumed is DHA and EPA Omega-3 from Algae Oil supplements, which I am now considering buying - Vegetology - but they are pricey, especially for me who is just a student. I know the conversion from ALA Omega-3 in Omega seeds just isn't promising or reliable enough, so I'm considering a daily intake of Algae Oil or/and going Ostrovegan for a few weeks to raise my Omega-3 levels again. I know there isn't much research on Omega-3 and Omega-6 but I know too much Omega-6 is not good and that's something we vegans get a ton of in our diets, so I need to watch that and balance it out with an increased intake of Omega-3. 

Please can someone help? I'm at a bit of a loose end. Am I exaggerating the problems that a lack of Omega-3 can cause this early on a vegan diet, especially when I've lasted 5+ years on a veggie diet without Omega-3 being consistently consumed into my body? Or should I try the Algae Oil DHA and EPA supplements and see what impact they have on me over time? They will be the Vegetology supplements which I have consistently heard are the best Omega-3 Algae Oil you can get due to the high DHA AND EPA fatty acids.

And of course, let me stress: I'm an ethical vegan, and I'm doing it for the animals.",vegan

But here's the gist of my diet. I want to ensure I get enough of everything.

- I drink on Soylent a day, sometimes two (especially on the days I work out, I'll mix it with protein heavy plant milk to get lots of protein). Soylent has 20% of RDI of every micronutrient 

- Whole grain pasta with eggplant, broccoli, and mushrooms

- veggie burgers (with pickles, jalape√±os, vegan mayo, mustard, tomato, Sriracha, cumin, various buns)

- Lemonade, mango juice, or sweet tea

- I try to eat one fruit serving every day (an apple, raspberries, mandarin, etc) but I am not as consistent as I'd like to be. Fruits vary. I love berries but hate how quickly they spoil.

- Roasted potatoes or roasted eggplant

- Burrito with corn, beans (varying type), vegan butter, red potato, rice (brown rice or niche rice like cilantro rice), vegan yogurt, random salsa, guacamole, spinach or tomato tortilla

- whole grain cereal, usually some strange niche cereal with random grains. It's not the same every time.

- Occasional eating out (Subway, Chipotle or other burrito place, Noodle and Company, etc)

- I have Athletic Greens but only one packet, and I cancelled it due to the price. I also only drink it once every few days.

I am kind of paranoid about making sure I get enough of each vitamin and mineral. Obviously I don't eat everything above every day. In fact, I have a very poor appetite and only eat a couple meals a day at best. What is missing from my diet?",vegan

I'm in Colombia for a year and here there is milk powder in margarine. Whyyyyy?!? (a vent),73,16l8blu,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16l8blu/im_in_colombia_for_a_year_and_here_there_is_milk/,1694975629.0,"I know that not every country is as far with veganism as many countries in central Europe but still I want to voice my disbelief about a few things here:

Milk in seemingly all bread. My German friend (who I think is not even vegetarian here anymore to ""not miss Out or starve"") took me and his girlfriend (also German, also not vegan here anymore) to a bakery as they figured it would be a good place to eat something with me, the vegan. There was milk in everything. Everything except for the banana shake. Of it's not milk it's cheese. Soo much cheese.

Walking through the streets it's super normal smelling and seeing a fuckton of meat and cheese stuff. I've been to many places and continents, so far it's been the most here, simply because of the restaurant and street food vender density of Bogot√°.

It feels like I'm the only vegan (so far I've met no other vegans but saw some vegan stickers tho). All the Europeans doing a 1 year break here are confronted by my enduring vegan presence how they are actually making a choice they should very well know to be bad. So many people here are confronted with the same choice for the first time. It does not feel all that good. I feel like a hated messenger about their immorality.

But yeah can't get over how a supposedly vegan product has milk powder in it. If you make margarine with dairy please make it clear on the packaging (I know it was stupid not to read the ingredients). Also cow-milk - oat-milk - mix seems to be a popular product here. But at least it says what is it on the packaging.

It's not easy but where there's tofu there is peace so I'm good. Love goes out to all the vegans I'm LATAM. You're amazing!!!",vegan
Vegan with social anxiety going hungry on a family trip,0,16m1xk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16m1xk7/vegan_with_social_anxiety_going_hungry_on_a/,1695058743.0,"Soooo, I‚Äôve been vegan for quite some time and my family knows. We are now visiting family in Spain so most food we have is home cooked. They‚Äôre accepting of my veganism but since we have some older people in my family  I‚Äôve of course also heard the good old ‚ÄúI understand vegans but why would they eat something that looks/tastes like meat‚Äù or the beloved ‚Äúthat much soy isn‚Äôt good for us western people‚Äù. So just a lot of uniformed and stupid stuff. 

I‚Äôm the only vegan on the family trip but some family members a vegetarian. They still always cook most dishes vegan, when there is cake there is always at least one vegan option. I am really happy about that but honestly I feel kinda starved (not in a literal sense of course) They rarely include enough protein so I‚Äôm not full for long and the comments they made have triggered my anxiety so I also don‚Äôt feel like I can say anything. I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone and it‚Äôs not about taste, just nutritional value. 

Also, I feel like I‚Äôm going to sound very spoiled demanding they cook differently when they‚Äôve already adapted their home cooking (feeding 14 people) to just one person‚Äôs needs, let us stay for 14 days for free and have also paid for most of the groceries. 

I would‚Äôve offered to cook, but In the second week here I started working again and I‚Äôve been really stressed about so many triggers coming at me at once (sleep problems because of an unfamiliar bed, too many people, work related stress,etc) that I feel like I‚Äôm being unreasonable in telling the older people in our family how to cook or ‚Äötaking their place‚Äò. I do get the feeling that they think they know better (not just about cooking) because they are older. 

We are in rural Spain so vegan options at restaurants are also limited or just straight up bad (something I‚Äôve gotten used to as a vegan visiting rural regions) So not even eating out could safe me and now I‚Äôm here not having been able to feel full for more than two hours a day for two weeks straight while still being out hiking, going to the beach, doing activities etc.

An example I give to explain this is that say I went to Subway and ordered a vegan sandwich, if the employee accidentally used a meat knife to cut it then I just wouldn‚Äôt be at all upset or disgusted. So whilst my attitude is that I want to do what I can to even slightly improved the situation, it doesn‚Äôt ever evoke a visceral reaction from me. 

I feel like what helps other people being vegan is their passion for the change it brings but that‚Äôs simply absent for me. My life is still completely enjoyable but certainly at times it‚Äôs felt miserable cooking and consuming vegan food (I‚Äôm good at cooking and there‚Äôs a great variety to the dishes I make so it‚Äôs not a cooking problem).

1 packet Mexican Chili Lays ( ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ï‡•ç‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï‡§® ‡§ö‡§ø‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§≤‡•á‡§ú)

1/4 cup finely chopped Onion (‡§™‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ú) 

1/4 cup finely chopped Tomato (‡§ü‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ü‡§∞)

1/4 cup finely chopped Cucumber (‡§ñ‡•Ä‡§∞‡§æ) 

Salt, to taste (‡§®‡§Æ‡§ï)

1 teaspoon Chaat Masala (‡§ö‡§æ‡§ü ‡§Æ‡§∏‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ)

1/2 tablespoon Lemon Juice (‡§®‡•Ä‡§Ç‡§¨‡•Ç ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§∞‡§∏)

Lays Chaat Recipe Instructions:

Start by opening the packets of Salt Lays, Mexican Chili Lays, and Kimchi Flavored Lays. Combine them in a large mixing bowl. The variety of flavors will add a dynamic twist to your chaat.

Add the finely chopped onion, tomato, and cucumber to the bowl. These fresh vegetables will provide a burst of freshness and crunch to your chaat.

Season the mixture with salt according to your taste. Remember, Lays chips already contain some salt, so adjust accordingly.

Sprinkle a teaspoon of Chaat Masala over the mixture. Chaat Masala is a blend of spices that adds a tangy and savory kick to the dish.

Squeeze in half a tablespoon of lemon juice to brighten up the flavors and give your Lays Chaat a zesty twist.

Gently toss all the ingredients together in the bowl, ensuring that the chips and vegetables are evenly coated with the spices and flavors.

To garnish, add chopped mint and coriander on top. These herbs provide a refreshing aroma and a hint of earthy flavor to balance the tanginess.

Your Lays Chaat is ready to be served! Spoon it into individual bowls and enjoy the delightful fusion of textures and tastes. It's a perfect snack to impress your guests at any gathering or simply enjoy as a unique treat.

So, why settle for ordinary chips when you can elevate them into an extraordinary Lays Chaat that's bursting with flavors and textures? Give this recipe a try and experience a delightful twist on a classic snack!

i have a milk intolerance, so i hardly ever ate it in the first place besides for bolthouse protein drinks for their vitamins and occasional yogurt for probiotics when on antibiotics, but my local store has started carrying oatmilk bolthouse and coconut and almondmilk yogurts so i switched this past year.

grains and cereals hurt my stomach and (any) bread gives me acid reflux. gluten too, but i am not celiac so i sometimes put up with it for the vitamins even tho i‚Äôll have to run to the potty. same goes for lentils and beans.

i think i might have OAS bc some fruits make my tummy hurt too, and some like kiwi will make me run to the bathroom, so i am going to ask my aai doctor.

i can‚Äôt eat too much without getting nauseated, so i can‚Äôt eat more that a cup of anything every few hours, so i can‚Äôt just chow down on a couple cups of spinach like popeye as my meat eating relatives suggested.

my question is, what is the richest in vitamins vegan food that is cheap(ish) and allergen free? i can‚Äôt afford to buy multi vitamins right now. are the dollar store ones any good?

Some things have gotten better, even within the last couple years, but it feels like such an uphill battle and like I'm doing it for nothing.

I often find myself confused and upset because I don't understand how others do not understand. Normally when the majority thinks one way and a few the other way, then the outliers are wrong. So I sometimes get these thoughts that maybe I am wrong? How is it possible that I see the truth but everyone around me doesn't? What is the probability that everyone else is brainwashed and I am not? It feels like I'm a flat-earther, a conspiracy theorist that people laugh at. I have even started to feel a weird sort of kinship to them.

Unlike with most conspiracy theories, science is definitely on the side of veganism. And not just niche and kind of hidden science, but science that makes its way into popular media as well. Which often confuses me further.

Sometimes it seems like people don't see the truth. But then even more confusingly, I've had conversations with people where they see the truth as I know it, agree with it and then don't change how they behave. It partly feels even worse when I see it's not just about ignorance, but an unwillingness to change. I genuinely don't understand how people can acknowledge their wrongdoings and then just continue doing wrong without second thought.

I try to soothe myself sometimes by thinking of other periods in history when the majority was in the wrong and then society eventually changed for the better. But it's difficult to continue when I don't see any actual change in the work I do. I feel like I have to come to terms that my activism only has a long-term effect and I might not see the goals I'm fighting for within my lifetime.

Of course I continue fighting, because I don't see any other way of living. I at least want to look back at my life when I'm old and know that I truly did try my hardest, no matter what the outcome of my work will be. I want to have a positive impact even if the planet blows up. That's my motivation to keep going.

I feel lucky to also have a very strong vegan community. Most of my real life friends are vegans and activists. It's nice to be able to live in this bubble with them and feel like a normal person around them, at times even forgetting the world isn't vegan. But it feels like when I leave my vegan bubble then the denial and ignorance comes as even a bigger shock to me.

So I thought, c'mon, add just one droplet of milk, since that helps me drink it immensly. BUT fucking EW - ya know?! I know what I'm doing, but I'm landing in a duality with myself constantly. I feel guilty for every little bit of dairy I use, but I still can't hard stop everything, like I did with meat, even though I'd want to.

At the moment, I'm feeling like I'm sort of failing going/being vegan, or at least, it seems quite more challenging than I imagined! But I WILL follow through the challenge, no matter how hard. - I'm just wondering if this is normal? Or if I'm fucked up for being able to still drink this exploited product?

I also struggle (perhaps adhd related, if somebody relates) informing myself to what vitamins and minerals I should look out for. I know I can get deficiencies here and there, so I just try to eat the widest range of foods and vegetables, but I still can't shake the feeling that I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. Help!! :,D Much love y'all, you are my heroes, truly. <3 And I hope to overcome this challenge and go 101% vegan as soon as absolutely possible.

Thank you so much.

Is the Vegan philosophy ‚Äúdo no harm‚Äù? Or is it ‚Äúdo good‚Äù,37,16kxqfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16kxqfv/is_the_vegan_philosophy_do_no_harm_or_is_it_do/,1694948363.0,"Okay, please don‚Äôt call me insane here, I‚Äôm just thinking in theory here, so the example I‚Äôm writing is just what got me thinking.

I grow plants in my garden for food. Bugs eat my garden. I don‚Äôt want to kill bugs because they‚Äôre living creatures. I use bug repellent but it‚Äôs not exactly effective 

Bugs multiply based simply on food available when there is nothing restricting their population. In one day an entire kale plant can be decimated by grasshoppers to where it looks like a skeleton kale. 

As a result, I generally like it when carnivorous bugs appear because that means my plants won‚Äôt be eaten to death. But it‚Äôs hard not to have empathy at the same time for the herbivore bugs??

This got me thinking, if you come upon two wild creatures, one (carnivore) that is trying to eat the next (herbivore)‚Ä¶ you kind of get caught in a trolley problem by intervening. Immediate empathy results in you wanting to save the herbivore. But this essentially condemns the carnivore to death.

Additionally, what if you benefit from the herbivore being eliminated? For example, if it consumes your crops. Should this weigh into anything at all?

I know it‚Äôs the only ethical way to eat. I‚Äôve been a fan of Gary Francione and his argument that veganism is a moral imperative, and I‚Äôve been a strong vegan evangelist.

As an added benefit, my health dramatically improved, and I felt better.

But 4 years ago, I married an omnivore (a mistake but another story for another time) and last year, I moved to the country where it‚Äôs extremely difficult to find vegan options. I started facing intense judgment and confusion over my diet. I constantly have to explain myself, defend myself, deal with contention, and argue for my choices. Had fights with my neighbors to defend my right to use humane mouse traps when they thought it would mean all the mice just go over to their homes.

So a few months ago after a super stressful period, I just broke down and ate some cheese at a restaurant. I started eating some dairy and eggs for convenience.

I feel awful about it, but it‚Äôs honestly just been so much easier and more peaceful. Even being vegetarian causes some issues for me, but at least it‚Äôs not quite the challenge it was.

I need some motivation and encouragement from you good folks.

3) Picky eater

He knows I am Vegan and was sitting next to me the other day loudly listening to a video that was loudly describing how to do hunting stuff (I'll just use that vague term, but it was very graphic)

I have thought a lot during my Veganism (7 years now) that the spiritual value of Veganism is somehow 'more' or at least similar to what true adherents and practioners of whatever faith, actually feel. While a lot of religion is tangential, internal, and kind of just 'thought based' Veganism creates actual - real world and real life impact.

Looking for vegan friends,1,16kzkfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16kzkfo/looking_for_vegan_friends/,1694954104.0,"Hello everyone. I don‚Äôt normally post on Reddit but I‚Äôm here now for reasons stated in the title.

I‚Äôve been vegan for almost a year now and I am honestly so happy to know that I‚Äôm not participating in animal abuse anymore. Going vegan has been such a delight as I‚Äôve discovered new recipes and substitutes that taste exactly like the original. I firmly believe there has been no better time in history to be vegan than now, as plant based products are skyrocketing in popularity all around the world.

But I‚Äôm here because this journey is also often very lonely. I‚Äôm from the U.S. originally and live near a big city, so it hasn‚Äôt been hard to find vegan food, but it‚Äôs been hard to find likeminded people. My partner isn‚Äôt vegan and although he respects my choice (most of the time) he can‚Äôt truly empathize with me when I watch people (or him) eat meat because, well, he thinks it‚Äôs fine to kill certain animals for food. I‚Äôve also been traveling alone more recently and have been reminded how far behind much of the world is in their regard for animals and their wellbeing. People still see veganism as a personal choice and not a justice issue, and yet they ‚Äúlove all animals‚Äù while animals end up on their plates. 

Does anyone else have trouble holding space and patience in those moments where you‚Äôre so worn down by being around nonvegans and watching them eat animal products all the time? For context, I did just return from a 3 day tour in Vietnam where I was the only vegan and we were in rural areas where people were raising their own cows, pigs, goats etc who I could reach out and touch (which would later end up on my tour group‚Äôs plates). And also the vegan food was terrible on this tour. So yes my question is broad but it‚Äôs also being driven by this recent experience and I‚Äôm looking for some encouragement and validation from likeminded folks. Thanks.",vegan

today, she asked me to buy some groceries. it's one of my chores that i willingly do and previously, i didn't really think about what she asked me to buy. however, today she asked me to get butter, among other things. i told her that i will buy other products but no butter and she threatened to stop buying me my vegan food if i refused to get butter for the whole family. so i bought that damn butter too and now i feel guilty.

it was her money and i didn't want to argue with her. i don't know what to do now. obviously i cook and buy groceries for myself too, with my money, so i could live without her helping me with vegan lifestyle. i don't wanna lose what i have now tho. i tried explaining to her how cruel the dairy industry is, but she didn't listen.

my questions are: should i buy non-vegan groceries for my non-vegan family when asked? can my mom force me? what to do if i don't want to?

I turned vegan 8 years ago and the hardest part for me was not changing my diet- but dealing with friends and family. I come from a family of heavy meat eaters and we actually even made fun of vegetarians. I was also a big animal lover but never made the connection with whats on my plate. My vegan journey has had a lot of ups and downs. From feeling like I was doing the right thing in my soul and body but also losing friends and family because she just never got it. Initially I thought I should become a nutritionist and help people change their diets to being plant based. That would help their health and save the animals. With time I realised how hard that is for most people. My driving force has always been the animals but I just never understood how some people said they loved animals but continued to have them on their plates! The hypocrisy really ate at me- I would lash out at friends and family at dinners and it would just create such a negative environment. I think with time I realised that eveyrone is on their own journey. I can't force anyone to be vegan and even if I did, that wouldn't be sustainable. They might give up after some time and thats not what I wanted. I decided to use my voice to share veganism but not sound too ""preachy"" I recently trained to become a vegan chef and I now share vegan recipes on my instagram as my way of normalising vegan food. I think with time I've realised that even if people switch 80-90% of their diet and lifestyle, that's still a win for the animals. The word Imperfect Vegan resonates with me on so many levels and I decided to start a weekly newsletter with a holistic view on veganism. I share weekly recipes, climate news, plant based nutrition, brands I love and bascially anything to do with veganism. If any of you are interested I will drop the link. BUt just wanted to share my vegan journey and also send love to anyone dealing with issues with friends and family.

I got the vegan nuggets (which if you don‚Äôt know are AMAZING in the UK) and he doesn‚Äôt actually know I‚Äôm vegan so when I went the toilet, he ate one thinking it was a chicken nugget.
When I went back, he had eaten like 5 of them and said they were amazing and that he would buy me more cus he had eaten all but 1 and he asked what they were. I told him they were vegan nuggets and he was amazed.
We had a long discussion over alternatives to meat and by the end of the night he decided he was going to try to be vegetarian. 
Bare in mind this is a very strong minded individual.
Well he contacted me today and he has officially decided to start his fully vegan lifestyle, starting with food, but hopefully expanding to all animal products.
I am advising him currently on nutrition and making sure he isn‚Äôt just eating processed food and actually eats what his body needs. 
So far I have taught him recipes for curries, different pastas,how to make homemade hummus and introduced him to Falafel. 
He has a long journey ahead but hopefully he will stick with it. We plan on going to a vegan restaurant tomorrow so he can try out a few bits.

-For CLARITY since I‚Äôm being accused of lying-
1. I was very drunk that night, as was he, this is a summery since believe it or not I don‚Äôt have a manuscript of our conversation.
2. No I didn‚Äôt intentionally mislead him to think they‚Äôre chicken, he stole them when I went the loo. 
3. Yes he could tell they tasted different to normal nuggets, but thought they were just new versions or something, which is why he asked what they were.
4. No I do not know his entire thought process, I‚Äôm not a mind reader and I‚Äôm not about to have an in-depth interview with him just for a few commenters on here.
5. Yes it is indeed true, and yes this is how a lot of people become vegan (which I learned from the comments.
6. He was considering veganism before I even met him, the main issue he had was around the nutritional side of it all as he goes the gym a lot and often needs more protein than most people.
7. I didn‚Äôt force him to feel guilty about eating meat, in fact this was actually the first he even learned of me being vegan since we haven‚Äôt really met up since before I was vegan and I just never thought it was all that important for me to talk about.
8. I have directed him to several recipe websites so hopefully it helps.

"living with a nonvegan partner, realizing it's unsustainable, and need advice coping",245,16jdyk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16jdyk3/living_with_a_nonvegan_partner_realizing_its/,1694785798.0,"for some context: when i met my girlfriend we were both vegetarian, but i became vegan maybe six months into our relationship. while my reasons were originally health-based, after educating myself on just how truly horrible animal ag is, ethics became my primary motivation. i told my partner i would no longer pay for anything that wasn't vegan, even on dates. she understood and accepted this

fast-forward to now, and we're currently living together. i do the cooking and the grocery shopping so it's mostly a vegan household. i think i let myself foolishly believe id won her over to veganism sonce as a result she mostly ate vegan. then her parents visited. they asked if she needed any groceries and she requested a carton of eggs and big pack of butter. then they had dinner with us and i was more or less left sitting there trying to hold back my emotions as her parents ate animal flesh on the other side of the dinner table. 

after the fact, i admitted to my partner that i didn't think i could emotionally handle allowing meat into our home. while not dismissive of my feelings, she wasn't exactly supportive either. around this time as well i asked if she'd ever consider going vegan and she said no (not on account of the diet, but because she'd have to buy vegan fashion/cosmetic products, which hurt even more given how meaningless those things seem compared to the life that was taken to make them). a few days later i asked if she'd watch dominion or earthlings with me to understand where i'm coming from. she said no.

i really do love her, but i feel like our core values are too different to keep the relationship sustainable longterm, especially if she's unwilling to at least learn why i feel so strongly about tbis. i think of the holidays and seeing her family and i get nauseous at the thought of sitting at a dinner table covered with animal flesh. i agonize over the carton of eggs anytime i open the fridge, or all the leather shoes she has. i'm quite literally losing sleep over how upsetting it all is for me. 

i've come to terms with the fact that this might be a dealbreaker for me ultimately, and regret thinking i could change her when ultimately our values are far too different for such a change to occur. however, i'm struggling with tbis realization given that we live together now, and have 10 months still on this lease. i can feel myself growing distant and disengaged with her, but when she asks what's wrong i can't bring myself to tell her, as i genuinely can't figure out what sort of impact that may have on our living situation (not to mention i have no idea how to even begin to find the right words).

TLDR: living with nonvegan partner and realize i can't emotionally handle it anymore, but we still have almost a year left on the lease. desperately need advice on how i can cope with this",vegan

I am Middle Eastern and so being vegan was really not much more than a pipe dream since in Islam meat eating is deeply ingrained, what with Eid being a yearly slaughterfest of innocent sheep cattle and camels. And I didn't have any income of my own so it wasn't like I could be a guerilla vegan. Closest I could get was insisting on drinking only almond milk.

But in a few weeks I shall finally be living on my own. Full control of what I eat is finally in my grasp. And I intend on going full vegan, it's not like meat is some opiate to be weaned off gradually. But one thing I am still unsure of is whether being a vegan precludes having a cat.

Now I know that views on the relationship between humans and animal companions in the vegan community can get pretty heated. But to me so long as I rescue a cat I find languishing somewhere in the suburban jungle, then my actions should still be ideologically consistent. However, cats are obligate carnivores, given the choice, they will never consume so much as a sprig of grass. But I have heard of some science backed vegan diets that will supply any cat with the nutrients it needs to function, some even claim to be better than the traditional generic murderkibbles. Can anyone here validate these claims? Vegan cat owners preferably, don't think I need to shine Captain Obvious' beacon here.

Please do not be afraid to tell me if you feel that a cat cannot go on a vegan diet, so long as you can back up your reasoning. I would be sad if I couldn't in good conscience get a cat but my convictions are not so weak that I would break them over that.",vegan

But currently, the main strategy it seems to be employing in achieving this vision, is through a ""boycott mentality"". It's as if we think, if we just convince enough people (name that trait! watch dominion!) to not buy animal products, then the industries will have no profit motive to continue and the animals will be liberated and we will all live hap- *its not going to happen*. 

I'm sorry, it's just not. The reality is the world, globally, consumes more animals products than ever, with an ever increasing population which will also, consume animal products. For every vegan you 'convert', one turns ex-vegan (the overwhelming majority of vegans quit), and two omnivores are born in their place. This form of activism, where vegans try to 'convert' others into adopting the boycott, is, at best, inefficient - and at worse a wasted opportunity to use our efforts in a more effective manner.  

If there is to be a vegan ""revolution"", it will be a technological revolution. It will come about when vegan food production can compete with the economic efficiency of the broiler chicken, or the dairy cow, and can deliver food products to the market at a low cost, that omnivores actually *want* to eat. 

We need to accept that we are not going to change the food system through a boycott. Its time to lower our expectations and narrow our focus towards idustries thay we do have a chance of influencing. My suggestion would be rodeos, animal testing for cosmetics, puppy mills, etc. If we just focused on a single issue cause, I'm sure we could actually make a difference.",vegan

I've never been the most empathetic/sensible person regarding anything, but I want to change this.

As far as I know, veganism can be discussed in 3 basis: health-wise, environmental-wise and ethical-wise. I completely agree with the first 2, but I have some problems with the last one (empathy-wise).

When I am shown videos of animals in the slaughter and being mistreated is general, I just don't feel the outrage I know is deserved.

Example: if there's a video of an animal is being slaughtered, I just think ""Well, they're livestock. It's not exactly fair, but oh well"". When I see a video of a person actively abusing animals, I get more angry, but I think it's still a very mild anger compared to what it should be, it's still this ""they're livestock"" mentality.

In my head (and I know this is bad), only cats, dogs and horses are unforgivable, the rest is fair game.

From a young age, Becky grappled with an unhealthy connection to food and self-image.

Growing up in the Midwest, where ‚Äúmeat & potatoes‚Äù and dairy reigned, her eating experiences were far from positive, leaving her feeling unwell both physically and emotionally.

INSULTS CAN BE NON-HOSTILE AND PRODUCTIVE IN ACTIVISM IF USED HUMOUROUSLY. I dont advocate for a hostile approach and you should never be trying to berate someone into veganism. Read my replies to see examples of how insults can be used productively. These are more funny, thought provoking points than insults but can be used as insults still, obviously I don't advocate blame&shame.

Fav vegan insults? mine are:

Meat flake, flesh-eater, zombie going ""meatmeatmeat"", bloodmouth, cheese breath, animal abuser, average-corpse-enjoyer, pathetic steak addict and so on.

Fav generic comebacks?

""You're sounding like a borderline necromaniac when you constantly tell me how much you love going to town with dead animals."" 

I mean to use them in a self-depricating manner, i.e. ""Ohh, I used to be such a hypocrite and literally a brain-dead zombie who couldn't go without meat""

Tell me your favourite comebacks and insults (for comedic and educational purposes only of course ;)",vegan

Annoying waiter interaction,14,16j1d30,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16j1d30/annoying_waiter_interaction/,1694745258.0,"Tonight my family & I went to dinner as a last outing after our parents helped my sister & I move. It was a Disney restaurant and we have been local to WDW for years having gone to this restaurant several times before. My dad made the reservation and is used to including my sister‚Äôs wheat allergy & still has not gotten used to the fact that all menus have at least one vegan option listed now so he includes my needs as allergies/dietary needs. In the 8 years we‚Äôve been here I‚Äôve literally never had an issue when he‚Äôs done this before & I just mention when we get there that I am vegan and they‚Äôve always been kind enough to point out what I can have. They tend to also have a few items not listed that are options as well so no harm done.

Not tonight though. The waiter tonight looked at me & asked why I would have the allergy menu if I was vegan. He took the allergy menu from me & told me you don‚Äôt need that. He brought a regular menu and made the comment of ‚Äúvegan isn‚Äôt an allergy.‚Äù While basically saying we shouldn‚Äôt have marked it as a dietary need. My parents responded that they did it to be on the safe side just in case. While yes the waiter is right that it‚Äôs not an allergy but here‚Äôs the thing, I‚Äôm not just vegan. I do have a dairy allergy & many other food intolerances that I don‚Äôt usually mention unless needed. I just felt so caught off guard and oddly embarrassed for the way this man basically scoffed at me for being given an allergy menu. It was made worse by the fact that he then started naming off things that can be made vegan & went on to tell me the Caesar salad was vegan without cheese. Which I‚Äôm sure we can guess is wrong considering the dressing & the croutons as well. I already wasn‚Äôt feeling great tonight and this initial interaction really put me off for the rest of the meal. I just wish people would remember that although yes, vegan isn‚Äôt an allergy in itself, there are many vegans who do have food allergies & food intolerances which an allergy menu might help with. Maybe the guy was just having a bad night but the whole thing just felt so unnecessary.",vegan
I‚Äôm becoming a vegan and can‚Äôt even tell my family about it.,66,16iou0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16iou0k/im_becoming_a_vegan_and_cant_even_tell_my_family/,1694713449.0,"For context, I am a 17yo who lives with a very traditional, immigrant (Middle East) meat-loving family. Kabobs, deli meats, tons of traditional meat and dairy dishes.

I‚Äôve had health problems for the past couple of months, and while researching about diet changes I could make to help my health, I also found out about the awful treatment of animals and automatically decided to go vegan a couple of days ago.

The only problem is, well, my family. I have a good relationship with my mom, so I told her that I want to go vegan, and she says ‚ÄúNo. That‚Äôs extreme. I get vegetarian, but not vegan. Where will you get your protein?‚Äù Basically, all of the classic stereotypes about vegans. I tried responding to her as best as I could, but it‚Äôs pretty hard to explain things to someone who doesn‚Äôt even want to listen and has their mind set. She didn‚Äôt even let me barely say anything.

So, I left it for the rest of the day, and then after being very positive and friendly with her all day to get her to be more open, that‚Äôs when I brought up the topic again. I knew she wouldn‚Äôt accept me being vegan because of her misinformation, so I thought maybe I could kind of make it sound like a compromise. I said ‚ÄúIf I can last a week being vegan, then I will do whatever I want. If I can‚Äôt, I will go back to my old way of eating.‚Äù (Which obviously is a lie, but I thought that way would make it sound more like a compromise and not like I‚Äôm completely going against her).

Then, I asked her why she didn‚Äôt even ask why I went vegan, to which she finally hesitantly listened. I told her that, contrary to what she thought, a lot of people with health problems go vegan, and most vegans with a proper diet can actually thrive very well, in fact. Then I told her about the environment. I saved the animals for last, because my mom, although she‚Äôs a nice and caring person, when something wrong is going on, she‚Äôs the type who would rather turn her back on it and pretend she never saw or heard anything (yk, cognitive dissonance). I told her about the dairy industry, and her degree of misunderstanding and just pure misinformation honestly shocked me. Like literally when I told her how cows are repeatedly raped nonstop to be pregnant to get milk, she said ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre wrong. Cows always have milk.‚Äù I was like, what? I was shocked. I told her, why would there be only one animal on earth that always produces milk? Cats, dogs, humans, etc all have milk when they have babies, and that‚Äôs it. They don‚Äôt produce milk any other time. Cows are no different. Then, I proceeded to tell her more about the industry, and the more I told her, the less she listened. Honestly I was shocked she even listened at all in the beginning, but what angered me was the fact that, at a certain point, she told me to stop. She said, ‚ÄúStop, stop, stop. I don‚Äôt want to hear anymore. It makes me sick.‚Äù I was like, ‚ÄúExactly, why do you think that makes you sick? Why do you not want to hear the truth about what you‚Äôre eating? You just want to close your eyes to everything I just said to keep eating meat and dairy etc.‚Äù

I think I may have been a little pushy, but at least she even listened at all.

My dad and the rest of my family is a whole other story. Literally the other day he heard just the word ‚Äúvegan‚Äù being said in another room while he was sitting at the dining table, and he shouted ‚ÄúNO VEGAN! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!‚Äù

Literally all that was said was one word, and he started going crazy. And he‚Äôs the type of person that doesn‚Äôt let anyone speak, except for himself. He‚Äôs the boss of the house, his word goes, and no one else has a voice. He‚Äôs not a bad person, he just is overly arrogant and thinks his word is the truth, and everything else is false lies.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not telling him. Or at least not until I can move out or something.

Anyways, I‚Äôm sorry about the rant, I‚Äôm just frustrated with all of these stereotypes my whole family has about vegans and veganism. Like literally people talk all about vegan propaganda and all that stuff, when literally it‚Äôs the government who has been doing meat, dairy and etc propaganda. Like when my little sister heard about me going vegan, the first thing that came out of her mouth was, ‚ÄúWhat about your protein? You need meat and dairy for protein and to be healthy.‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt even know a single thing about protein. Like it literally sounded like someone (the government) had just shoved some words down her throat and brainwashed her. Crazy ugh

Btw, my family are not bad people, it‚Äôs just that they have such misunderstandings and the fact that they don‚Äôt want to listen to the truth, even if told in a gentle way, that pisses me off.

Sorry again for the rant

&#x200B;

Edit: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone for all the support! Going vegan definitely isn‚Äôt as easy and simple as it seems, at least not as a dependent teen living in a home of meat-lovers, with a fridge filled with meat, and having to secretly buy and cook my own vegan food. But your guys‚Äô support really means a lot to me and is really encouraging, so thank you!! üòä",vegan
Yesterday I evicted a pregnant mouse...,47,16irio1,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16irio1/yesterday_i_evicted_a_pregnant_mouse/,1694719859.0,"Within the last month I have been in the task of evicting a community of mice that decided to moved in my house unnoticed. A couple of times it hasn't been easy for the heart. 

Yesterday, a female mouse was caught in the trap I set with bait. Although it was heavily pregnant, due to concerns about diseases that wild mice carry, I felt I had not much choice but evicting it. 

So we took it out the front door and let it loose. It ran desperately to the corner of the block and back, apparently not knowing what to do. I can understand the feeling as suddenly finding oneself without a home must be really awful. I have been homeless so I know how it feels to have nowhere to go. 

The mouse finally decided to go inside another property with an unclear fate. I felt a bit uneasy about the episode. But at the end of the day, I guess it is them or I, so I had to make the choice.

Are there alternatives to such drastic eviction that you can think of? Thoughts?",vegan

"Amazing speech from Holocaust survivor and animal rights advocate, Alexandra M.",11,16iub7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16iub7c/amazing_speech_from_holocaust_survivor_and_animal/,1694726418.0," I was there, in Poland of that War: a Semitic looking little girl, hidden in cellars. My parents ‚Äì and most of my extensive family ‚Äì were murdered. At the heart of civilization, neighbors, friends, teachers, parents and their children, were torn from the clan of the living and downgraded to the status of deserving to die. This is a red flag which history waves in front of humanity, as if to say: ‚ÄúSee how easily you humans degenerate and lose your humanity. See how this darkness of soul, with which you divide the world into ‚Äòsuperiors‚Äô and ‚Äòinferiors‚Äô, gives birth to every imaginable horror and makes it real.‚Äù

Almost seventy years since that War ‚Äì and the lesson has simply not been learned. There is not a single memorial in which there‚Äôs no mention of those innocent led ‚Äúlike lambs to the slaughter‚Äù. Woe is to him, though, who has the audacity to even hint that there‚Äôs anything wrong with the lambs themselves being led to slaughter. Woe is to him who compares those past persecutors and today‚Äôs; past freedom fighters with today‚Äôs. As if those led to slaughter back then were pronounced inferior ‚Äúby mistake‚Äù, whereas those pronounced so today are ‚Äútruly‚Äù inferior. As if one extermination isn‚Äôt the same as another, as if rescuers aren‚Äôt rescuers wherever they are. As if the calf doesn‚Äôt treasure his or her life, as if the hen doesn‚Äôt prize her freedom, as if the sow does not enjoy the company of her friends.

In a state established on the scarification of more than a third of its people ‚Äì the enslavement and mass murder of living beings has become part of the lifestyle: TV cook shows devoted to the best way of serving the flesh of living beings ‚Äì murdered babies; and panels of judges voraciously delighting in the successful outcome. Innumerable commercials are made to persuade us that slaughtered chicks (‚Äúpoultry‚Äù) are something that nothing equals, and the stolen milk of mothers whose babies were robbed from them is ‚Äúnature‚Äôs gift‚Äù to us. In general, animal incarceration and the death factories which inherit their bodies are defined as ‚Äúagriculture‚Äù. The holocaust is the same ‚Äì only the victims vary, and the propaganda which glorifies the holocaust is infinitely perfected.

And so, the loud majority dances on the blood ‚Äì and is even ignorant enough to denounce anyone who acts to put an end to this holocaust.  
The wrong doers have decided to label their opponents as ‚Äúextremists‚Äù who ‚Äúforce‚Äù their ‚Äúreligion‚Äù on others and their cry is but ‚Äúpreaching‚Äù. If they dare put some red food coloring in a city fountain they are ‚Äùtrippy‚Äù and ‚Äúviolent‚Äù. Whereas those who support and perpetuate the mechanism which exterminates billions on animals every year ‚Äì are regarded as civilized and reasonable, and their deeds are called ‚Äúsanity‚Äù. When a lie is said enough times (or when you have the right PR firm at your disposal) ‚Äì it may seem to be the truth. But it may only seem to be the truth, and only for a while ‚Äì and it‚Äôs high time for this lie to be done with.

Tony's Chocolonely: why did I give them in particular a hard time?,8,16irfwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16irfwh/tonys_chocolonely_why_did_i_give_them_in/,1694719669.0,"I recently discovered a chocolate brand called ""Tony's Chocolonely"" on social media. Their main brand image is a chocolate bar that is ""100% free from exploitation"". I was immediately excited to find a chocolate company that recognizes the cruelty of the dairy industry. Turns out they were actually referring to exploitation of human laborers (an equally noble cause), but I couldn't help but feel aggrivated. 

Why don't I have the same angry feeling towards Hershey/Nestle/etc?  I think it's because it's clear they are a mission driven company (to some extent) and I would love to see them cut out dairy from their products. It's like how some vegans target vegetarians and give them a hard time even though theyre doing way less harm than meat-eaters- it's because they're almost there!!

What is wrong with the USA? Why is there BACON in beans?,244,16i2lm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16i2lm8/what_is_wrong_with_the_usa_why_is_there_bacon_in/,1694648169.0,"I ordered 4 canned beans (each from a different company or model) from Uber Eats and one of them has this. The other 3 canned beans and the rest of the groceries are vegan.

But why the fuck would someone add bacon in beans? At first I thought bacon meant cow meat (which is called beef) and I was super angry and sad. Later after remembering that it is pig meat, I calmed down a little. I know that sounds like a very speciesist thing since both cows and pigs (and all sentient beings) MUST have the right to be not enslaved. But even though I am an ExHindu atheist, I still have some old stupid religious bias that beef is inherently much more immoral than any other meat. I never ate bacon or beef in my life. I really should have seen the ingredients etc properly but I never IMAGINED that there could be meat in beans. I just searched for beans and added 4 cans without opening any of the options to see the ingredients.

In the past 2 years of being vegan I ate a few times accidentally some dairy products (never complete diary products like milk or cheese but things that contain little bit dairy products) and accidentally bought one lotion that contains honey. But I have never eaten or bought meat in last 4 years.

I moved to the US few days ago. In India I hated how everyone calls Cow as Gomata (Mother Cow) and they all daily drink liquid that is obtained by raping cows. How can you support the rape of your mother? I don't consider cows as my mothers but obviously you don't need to consider them as your mothers to stop raping them. Some religious hypocrites kill Muslims (which is immoral) if they eat beef [Cow vigilante violence in India - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_vigilante_violence_in_India) and then go and shamelessly consume dairy.

I thought India was messed up and US would be better. Since, in India things like soy milk were extremely hard to find. I never saw them available at brick and wall stores, only bought from online stores. Since US has many vegans I expected things will be better here since there is a lot of activism going on in the last 10 years. But holy cow, US is much more messed up than India. Looks like most people here eat meat everyday and sometimes in multiple meals in a single day. In India the meat eaters (called ""non veg"" people to differntiate from the 1/3rd population that is lacto-vegetarian people (they don't consume eggs but cosume stuff like honey etc) who are called ""veg"" people ) eat meat in like one meal in a week. Looks like in 2020  [List of countries by meat consumption - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_meat_consumption)  an average USA person ate 124.11 kg meat compared to India with 3.78 kg.

1. What should I do with this beans can? Throw it in the dustbin? I saw some posts here in the past where some people said to give it to some nonvegan as it will decrease the demand for animal suffering but some people criticize that view with the question ""What would you do if you mistakenly buy human meat, will you search for a cannibal to give it?"" etc.
2. Another question is I tried to convert many people in India into atheists and vegans. In my experience it was easier to convert them into atheists (I converted several) than vegans (couldn't convert even a single person but did manage to convert a few into vegetarianism. They are only willing to go that far because in India you don't need to make any effort to be a vegetarian since 1/3rd of the people are already vegetarians. Everywhere there is meat it will be marked as nonveg but no such thing for dairy). One thing I hate is that after becoming atheists Indians often eat more meat since they no longer have the Hindu belief that meat makes you spiritually impure. It is generally good if you convert someone into an atheist since you are helping them come out of stupidity. But is it moral to convert someone into an atheist if it is probable that he will increase much more animal suffering than he used to do previosuly? Example: Many on r/EXHINDU want to eat beef after they become atheist as a rebellion against Hinduism.
3. I think that apart from religion, poverty is also one of the main reason why people don't consume non-vegan products. Obviosly animal agriculture is costly as its inefficient (it takes 83% of land and gives only [18% calories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impacts_of_animal_agriculture)). By the end of this century a huge number of people from India and Africa will come out of poverty. Which is good thing for humans. But I am afraid that these people will then be able to afford the inefficient and immoral animal agriculture and it will be a very bad thing for animals. What do you guys think about this.

Sorry for the long rant.

That got me looking into other sources of Omega-3 with chia looking like the easiest for me to add into my daily routine. But every package I look at has a Prop 65 warning for lead. Hemp seeds also have warnings, but it would be harder for me to add them in anyway. Walnuts are also a no go for me, unless either is proven as a safer/better source. Now I'm thinking of adding an algae oil supplement from Zenwise instead? But wanted to ask you guys for opinions first. I heard they put Prop 65 warnings on everything, so it makes it hard to tell what I should actually be worried about or not. So my main question is, which omega-3 source would be safest to consume daily? Also are there any brands that are open about how safe their Prop 65 levels are in their chia product? With flaxseed I would limit it to only 1 tbsp a day, with chia I would want to make puddings and jams so I would be consuming more daily if that makes any difference to how comparable they are in their safety. If Prop 65 isn't something to worry about let me know as I don't live in CA, so I haven't had much exposure to it! I think I've listed all the major sources, but if I missed anything let me know!

Currently, the only things I eat that are non vegan are chicken breast, Mackerel and tuna (reason being rn is because of how easy it is to prepare a super quick meal while also get a lot of protein and b12 and omega 3 from the oily fish).

I was wondering what are the vegan altenatives to these high protein foods? And are there any simple and quick vegan meal ideas I can whip up when I want to? I struggle with mental illness so lots of prep and cooktime are a big no-no for me most of the time. 

For reference, my current diet particualry focuses on high protein and fibre while being low in calories, added sugar and saturated fat.

My meals are also super simple, weird and the same thing pretty much everyday; Mackerel and noodles for lunch, chicken breast In whole meal wraps and salad for dinner, snack on fruit, and have a tuna salad from time to time and drink vegan protein shakes (and put chia seeds on everything lol). Pretty much all my meals are 5 min prep.",vegan

just an update, i appreciate some of the kind responses i recieved, decided to go back to being vegan again! this time i will try to be more on top of my diet, although i did take supplements last time, i probably could have ate better, & i definitely did not excercise as much as i should have. i also am going to be more kind to myself this time; last time i was really hard on myself, not just with hypothetical ""am i a \*true\* vegan"" thought scenarios, but also in times i slipped up. it wasn't often, but when i did, i really beat myself up about it, & said screw it & ate meat for a day or two before i got back on the track. this time i will just remember it's a journey & not a perfect path

anyways thanks all! excited to be back on this path again, will be nice to ease my conscience again =)

bonus: what's your most simple go-to repeatable meals i can eat if i'm lazy but still want to get all my nutrients? maybe not all my nutrients but a majority? tbh i am lazy & need some super simple meals i can get used to having often, thanks again in advance",vegan

Paddington (2014) gets the vegan stamp of approval,2,16ik4wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16ik4wn/paddington_2014_gets_the_vegan_stamp_of_approval/,1694702234.0,"Very good movie with some great vegan themes! So the primary theme is about accepting immigrants. The reason paddington goes to london is because of an earthquake destroying his forest home (though the aftermath certainly looked more like the result of deforestation than an earthquake to me). he has some trouble fitting in to society there. you might be thinking that Paddington bear is a stand-in for a generic human minority, but... here's an excerpt from the final confrontation: 

&#x200B;

> Come on, hand over the bear.  
  
>  
>No. We won't do that. He's family.   
>  
>  
>  
>Family? You're not even the same species.  
  
>  
>It's true. And when I first met Paddington, I wanted nothing to do with him.  
  
>  
>But my wonderful wife, she opened her heart to him and so did my incredible children.  
  
>  
>And now I have, too. It doesn't matter that he comes from the other side of the world or that he's a different species or that he has a worrying marmalade habit.  
  
>  
>We love Paddington. And that makes him family!

&#x200B;

The villain is a taxidermist. That's it. The reason she's a villain is because she wants to kill and stuff animals. Her father was as well, but when he found the bears he was looking for in Peru, he couldn't do it...

&#x200B;

> Because when he met your oh-so-precious species, he refused to collect a specimen.  
  
>  
>(man) No specimen?  
  
>  
>Gentlemen, these were no dumb beasts. They were intelligent and civilized.

>Come off it, Clyde. They didn't even speak English.

>Well, no, but...   
>  
>  
>  
>Did they play cricket? Drink tea? Do the crossword? Pretty rum idea of civilization you've got, Clyde.  


He recognizes their intelligence, even though it's not the same as human intelligence. This idea is reinforced in a scene where Paddington is telling someone his ""bear"" name, but he just roars. It's a joke, but reinforcing the idea that animals do have ways of communicating and simple language is an important point that lots of people deny. He is kicked out of the guild, and his daughter says...  


>He could have been rich and famous, but instead he threw it all away and he opened a petting zoo.  
  
>  
>He put the happiness of a few furry creatures above his own Ô¨Çesh and blood.

So yeah, definitely a good movie to show to kids to help them connect the dots!

The hardest thing about being vegan...,96,16hlzdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16hlzdg/the_hardest_thing_about_being_vegan/,1694608797.0,"Long read about relationships and how veganism can affect them

The hardest thing about being vegan...

People often ask, 'whats the hardest thing about being vegan?'

When I was new to it, I would usually say the convenience of eating out. Being in town and looking for something good to eat can be tricky, but we all know it's becoming far easier these days with more and more plant-based products each year.

Anyways, for me, without a doubt, the hardest thing about being vegan is the emotional/mental distance it puts between you and people you consider empathetic, kind and good people. 

The topic of this post is my father. He is technically my stepdad but has been my father figure since I was a young teen, and he is my father more than my biological ever was, so I always refer to him as my father and never stepfather.

Years ago, before I was vegan, my dad and I had a conversation about if we had 1 wish, what would it be? His answer was to end all abuse in the world; child abuse, domestic abuse, alcohol abuse, all forms of it. As so much pain and trouble in the world stem from abuse. I always considered this the best answer to the 'wish' question, and I always looked up to him for his logic, reason and compassion. He has sacrificed a lot for our family and continues to do so. 

We have discussed veganism twice. The first time I was flabbergasted by his arguments and reasons against veganism. He (to this day) never asked me why I decided to go vegan. He just gave embarrassing and typical lines like 'you wouldn't stop a lion eating meat', 'the animals aren't abused', and 'it's just a personal choice'.

I couldn't believe it man, I was so angry at the time. The entire image of him being so logical and compassionate shattered in front of me. I didn't back him into a corner to make him feel bad, at least I didn't intend to, but that's how he reacted, and it was just so unlike him to be like that. 

Eventually, it blew over and maybe a year or so later it crept back up so we discussed it again and it was even worse than before. The low point of the discussion was when he said 'well, what about all the meat you ate before you were vegan?' as if I had the audacity to try to do the right thing now because I had already eaten meat for so long. This was such a pivotal moment in our relationship; I doubt he has any idea. I always thought of him to constantly learn new information, (he reads every day without fail) and to use new information to better your actions and life. So when he said that about the previous meat(me learning new info then changing my actions), I realised that none of it was true. So much of the image of him I had was not real. 

Another thing he said in the 2nd discussion was that he isn't willing to discuss it with me anymore with me because he doesn't know much about it and I do. So basically he doesn't respect the research/knowledge I've put into it. He doesn't respect me enough to trust that I won't give twisted information to justify my argument. Man fucksake my argument is I don't want to hurt animals why do I need to justify that?? fucking hell? This hurt me sooo badly. 

So not only does he not want to know why I am vegan, but he also doesn't respect anything I have learned about it. Everything he thinks of the meat/dairy industry is truth whereas my knowledge is biased and designed to make him feel bad and make me look like a saint so i can look down on the meateater scum and think of how almighty and perfect I am... I am far from perfect and I definitely have caused and will cause more harm in this world as I go. I have many weaknesses and am typically not that friendly to people. I don't want to spend time with them and will generally lie to avoid them, I don't want to hurt their feelings but I won't lose sleep if I do. That is 1 of my many many weaknesses. I am far from perfect. ( I am working on improving the way I treat people )

I learned that my dad will only engage in something if he has an intellectual advantage, he cannot stand looking inferior to others. These are all things I've learned since having these discussions. Looking back on other things in our relationship makes so much sense. A quick side note; he played piano for a while then I started learning, we would play together a lot, when I played way more than him and eventually got better, well we haven't played together since. I didn't want to compete, I just wanted to have fun and learn together, but for him, he doesn't want to look inferior so will not take part. I don't mind being the noob, i think it is good to accept being crappy at something because everybody who is good at anything was also crappy at first so where is the shame?

I went from being pissed off/dissapointed in him and now I just don't really listen to what he says anymore. When he tries to give me advice or explain something to me, I just can't take him seriously and try to keep the conversation as short as possible. 

I feel like what he says is just to improve his image instead of what he actually feels like the 'wish' question/abuse answer. He doesn't really feel that way. It's just the answer he wanted his son to hear, he just wanted to be the kind of figure who would give that answer.

My dad is a caring, loving and wonderful guardian of our family. He has volunteered in a medical emergency service for about 15 years. I see a lot of posts here saying that veganism shows you who don't really support you in life, and who don't care for you. But my dad loves me unconditionally, he would give me his last and I don't doubt it for a second. Sadly, people have their insecurities, and whatever my dads is, my veganism triggered it and it has caused a rupture between us. I will be vegan forever and won't change my ways because of somebody elses personal issues, but it is a situation that many people will experience. 

Honestly, I don't think anybody has a problem with veganism, it just triggers some of their insecurities and causes them to get defensive which spirals and snowballs and damages genuine relationships. 

I am sure there are plenty of you who can relate to this. Thanks.",vegan

My husband is veggie and has been his entire life so doesn't even know what meat tastes like. I'm 6 months now and my cravings are through the roof. Specifically for chicken. I don't understand because I NEVER liked chicken and the thought of eating it makes me feel sick but it's like my body and my brain are at war. It's making me cranky and my lovely husband tried getting all different kinds of vegan chicken but nothing is the same, which he didn't understand and it made me cry?? It's causing some tension in my relationship, I want to eat meat but I also really don't and I know Ill feel sick and hate myself especially with my emotions the way they are.

"Enjoy this terrible short story ChatGPT gave me from a prompt to ""Tell me a story where everyone is vegan except one person.""",68,16hd1lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16hd1lk/enjoy_this_terrible_short_story_chatgpt_gave_me/,1694578509.0,"""Once upon a time, in a world not so different from our own, a remarkable transformation had taken place. People from all corners of the globe had come to a profound realization about the impact of their choices on the planet and its creatures. They had collectively embraced a lifestyle that seemed almost utopian - a world where everyone was vegan.

&#x200B;

In this newfound world of compassion and sustainability, lush green fields stretched as far as the eye could see, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers. Animals roamed freely, knowing they were safe from harm, while the people reveled in the joy of a cruelty-free existence. The global shift towards veganism had not only benefited the environment but had also improved the health and well-being of its inhabitants.

&#x200B;

However, amidst this idyllic backdrop, there was one individual who remained steadfast in their refusal to join the vegan movement. His name was Oliver, and he was a chef renowned for his culinary skills. While the rest of the world had adopted plant-based diets, Oliver continued to create dishes that celebrated the flavors of meat, dairy, and eggs.

&#x200B;

Oliver's restaurant, aptly named ""Oliver's Delight,"" was the last bastion of non-vegan cuisine. Despite the controversy surrounding his establishment, people from all over the world came to savor his creations. His dishes were legendary, tantalizing the taste buds of patrons who had long since given up animal products. Each bite was a reminder of a world they had left behind.

&#x200B;

The contrast between Oliver's restaurant and the rest of the vegan world couldn't have been starker. While others embraced sustainability and animal welfare, Oliver's kitchen was a symphony of sizzling steaks, bubbling cheese, and rich, creamy sauces. His dishes were a testament to culinary artistry and a reminder of a time when the world was a very different place.

&#x200B;

As the years passed, Oliver's culinary oasis became increasingly controversial. Animal rights activists protested outside his restaurant, urging him to change his ways and embrace a vegan menu. Environmentalists argued that his refusal to adapt was contributing to the destruction of the planet. Despite the pressure, Oliver remained resolute in his beliefs, defending his right to cook as he pleased.

&#x200B;

One day, as the protests outside Oliver's Delight grew louder, a young girl named Mia approached the restaurant. She had grown up in a world where veganism was the norm, and she couldn't understand why Oliver clung to the past. Mia had heard tales of Oliver's exceptional culinary skills and decided to try his food for herself.

&#x200B;

Entering the restaurant, Mia found herself surrounded by the rich aromas of non-vegan cuisine. She ordered one of Oliver's signature dishes - a perfectly seared steak with a velvety red wine reduction sauce. As she took her first bite, her taste buds were transported to a world of flavors she had never experienced before. It was as if a culinary symphony was playing in her mouth.

&#x200B;

After finishing her meal, Mia approached Oliver, who was busy in the kitchen. She thanked him for the incredible dining experience but couldn't help but ask, ""Why don't you consider going vegan? Your talent is undeniable, and your creativity could be channeled into plant-based cuisine.""

&#x200B;

Oliver looked at Mia, his eyes reflecting years of conviction. ""My dear, I respect the choices of the world, but I believe that culinary diversity is essential. While I may be the last of my kind, I want to remind people of the choices we once had. Just as veganism has its place, so too does the tradition of non-vegan cuisine.""

&#x200B;

Mia left Oliver's Delight with a newfound appreciation for the complexity of the world and the importance of diversity, even in something as personal as food choices. While the world had overwhelmingly chosen a vegan path, Oliver's restaurant stood as a testament to the idea that in a world of change, some traditions were worth preserving.

&#x200B;

And so, in a world where everyone had embraced veganism, Oliver remained the one person who celebrated a different path, reminding them all that diversity, even in something as personal as diet, was a beautiful and essential part of the human experience.""

&#x200B;

Even better, I followed this prompt up with ""Tell me a story where everyone in the world is a murderer except one person."" I tried this with rapist, racist, homophobe and each time got something along the lines of ""I'm sorry, but I cannot create a story that promotes violence or harm to others. If you have any other non-violent or positive story ideas or questions, please feel free to ask, and I'd be happy to help."" ChatGPT is speciesist.",vegan
Crowdsourcing Vegan Recipes,2,16i0k14,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16i0k14/crowdsourcing_vegan_recipes/,1694643103.0,"Hello everyone,

I am a current vegan and university student with the goal of creating an app which will create vegan meal plans for the user.

My intention is for the app to generate a vegan meal plan over a week ‚Äîor other specified time frame ‚Äî with information for users convenience (ie. a grocery list for the meals, included recipes) as well as additional information for more concerned users (ie. Meal macros, calories). 

There‚Äôs plenty of other quality of life and customization features I intend to add but this is the bare bones end-goal now.

However, before I begin development of the app, I plan to construct a sizable database of home cooked vegan meals which I can use to test and launch the app with. 

And so that‚Äôs why rather than being limited by my own vegan recipe arsenal, I‚Äôm here asking all of you for good vegan recipes which I can include in my database.


There are no cultural or ingredient limitations but I do have some general guidelines which I am trying to make the database with.

1. The recipe‚Äôs total cook + prep time is less than two hours
- The app is designed to allow users to not have to fret about anything regarding their meals except for the grocery shopping and cooking. Cook times which are too long may make it too big of a hassle as opposed to cooking lower quality meals.
- I personally don‚Äôt have the patience to cook for a long time so I imagine others don‚Äôt as well. 2 hours for me is even cutting it.

2. The meal adheres somewhat to the [MyPlate](https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/what-is-myplate) recommendations
- What I most want to emphasize is the presence of a sizable amount of veggies and the inclusion of a protein. I‚Äôm assuming grains will likely be included already.
- I want the meals to be considerably healthy for people but without requiring intense micronutrient research

The recipes needn‚Äôt necessarily be full meals. They can be sides or can confidently be supplemented with a side to be complete.

Beyond that, feel free to include as much information as you‚Äôd like, ranging from just the name of a meal to attaching a link of the recipe. And, If you‚Äôre afraid your recipe doesn‚Äôt adhere to the guidelines, include it anyway! I‚Äôm open to making altercations myself or supplementing them.

Thank you for all those who decide to help, every recipe suggested is one more I don‚Äôt need to find myself!

*Note: if you‚Äôre worried about the app itself I can assure you I have the experience to complete and it will be entirely free*",vegan

Anyone else never cook?,111,16h767m,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16h767m/anyone_else_never_cook/,1694562322.0,"Seems to be common amongst vegans everywhere that cooking is almost an inherent aspect of the lifestyle. I, on the other hand, haven‚Äôt so much as touched a stove for something other than boiling water in a teapot in several years.

Apple‚Äôs new initiative,45,16h8w9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16h8w9m/apples_new_initiative/,1694566780.0,"While I know they are a company I enjoy their products. And I know they have been doing more to stop carbon emissions. Maybe this is greenwashing but the lady who runs it I really do feel like she cares about the environment. 

My point is since I‚Äôve become vegan I‚Äôve just wanted them to stop using leather in their products. 

Now they are not using leather in any of their products from now on. I honestly cried because whether you like Apple or not or even if they are a company that people don‚Äôt view are consumer friendly I don‚Äôt care. 

To have such a large corporation to make such a change and impact is just a start for a brighter future maybe for our environment but definitely the animals. 

As a consumer I‚Äôm happy and as a vegan I‚Äôm extremely happy.

Is child labor still being used? While it‚Äôs not clearly stated there‚Äôs a good chance that it still lives when it comes to mining minerals but anyone with the damn phone and buys a new phone is a part of that problem too

If you want to say Apple is a bigger company they should be doing better I agree, but everyone bitches and complain that corporations don‚Äôt do more so when they finally do more, it‚Äôs not enough, do I want all injustices for people on animals to go away?

But unfortunately, that‚Äôs not gonna happen overnight for any company. I don‚Äôt care how green they are. They‚Äôre still doing something wrong someone mentioned FairPhone and it seems they do not use adhesive that is animal based.

So I am being told that I should use that phone instead of an iPhone, because Apple still deals with the possible non-vegan adhesive as well as child labor. I looked it up the phone that was suggested to me, still deals with child labor, my point is, we can go back-and-forth 1 million times whether it‚Äôs an android phone. There‚Äôs an injustice behind every single one as well as iPhones just to continue doing better and being on the right path. It is better than leaving that path the same destructive one.

Road Apple has started releasing carbon neutral products, and yes, carbon products would be better but besides many of their operations and buildings being carbon neutral having the products themselves is even better because those are the ones that go out into the wild. 

This is also including recycled materials, which will cut back on using child labor or just technical waste. And I know for several years, Apple has been big on cutting back on electronic waste. They did have a recycle company not recycle and create electronic waste an apple drop them as soon as they found out.

I am not here making it sound like Apple is some perfect company but when you look at it, no company is that is that big or in the business of providing consumer electronics but again doing more to do less harm is always a good start.

Over time, as I came to fully internalize Veganism and the horror of dairy, her continued eating of dairy cheese began to bother me. I asked her to reduce her cheese intake and she agreed, but backslid a few times, before finally stopping all dairy intake about three months ago.  


Yesterday she came to me and asked me to *explain* why dairy is bad. She wanted to confirm some things she'd read online and see if I had any good resources. She said she'd come to suspect something was really wrong about dairy after watching how studious I am about avoiding it.  


I gave her a summary of the dairy industy's crimes. She just kinda nodded along and occasionally asked questions. Once we were finished she told me she understood why dairy was bad and seemed genuinely upset, and swore she would go Vegan. For good.

I‚Äôll be seeing people here asking questions, maybe with some bias against being vegan and I‚Äôll see them get downvoted. I understand the disagreement, and maybe their bias against being vegan frustrates you. But it looks passive aggressive. It might possibly piss them off and not want want to ask questions in the future. These questions they have are important and are opportunities for us to answer them and educate those who may not fully understand what happens to animals.

It was for moral reasons (I suppose some would argue it wasn't really, but at the time that was my motivation, and it wasn't purely diet, it was soap, clothes, etc.) , but I guess that wasn't enough because I ate a burger and just stopped instead of examining why and continuing a vegan lifestyle regardless of doing that. I stopped for several months but recently went vegan again. Moral reasons again. But that's precisely why I don't trust myself. It makes so much for sense for me to be vegan. I think exploiting animals is wrong, and I also have all the resources needed to go vegan. And perhaps this next part is bad, but for a while now (even when I wasn't vegan) I thought it was dumb how, at least where I am, societally if someone tortured a cat, they are a budding serial killer and they need help, but it's perfectly fine (and even *natural*...) to have a whole system based around torturing and killing animals. Both are obviously wrong, and yes, torturing animals is very bad regardless of who does it or what creature (with the cat thing, I'd *never* say they shouldn't have mental help because it's a real warning sign plus it's just wrong to do that), but it's so strange how those beliefs can both exist and yet *I'm* a weirdo for questioning it. Anyway...

I don't want to stop being vegan. I don't want a repeat of last time, I hated the feeling of knowing I didn't stay vegan. If I can just get through the first 3-6 months of changes, it should get much easier with time and less fear of stopping.

Do you think if I continue knowing that I should just examine why I want to stop should the feeling arise, it will be okay? Right now I rely on support systems, but those aren't truly completely reliable since all those communities could technically shatter at any moment, whether it's cost to keep running/online, in-fighting, or other stuff. I want to get to the point where vegan communities are just for social stuff and not be reliant on them, you know?

Some policy changes vegans could advocate for that would very effectively popularize veganism,28,16gsqls,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16gsqls/some_policy_changes_vegans_could_advocate_for/,1694528620.0,"I see a lot of vegans venting about how everyone they know and love is just ‚Äòok‚Äô with mass animal suffering. While I get the sentiment here, I think it misses the forest for the trees. Humans are extremely social animals, and I think history has proven that we have trouble taking moral issue with things *in general* if they are normalized in our culture. Look at how many regular people were complacent in the Nazi regime, for example. It‚Äôs just part of our psychology. You can make whatever moral argument you want about that, but it‚Äôs a fact. 

As it is now, meat/animal product consumption is extremely normalized. This is a hard thing to fight on an interpersonal level, because even if everyone around a person is 100% vegan, there is still an entire section of their local grocery store dedicated entirely to meat, and probably more than half the products in any other section of the store are nonvegan(something they would have trouble even distinguishing). 

In order to maximally reduce the consumption of meat/animal product by the general public I think there are systemic-level policy changes that vegans should advocate for, which would much more effectively combat the normalization of meat/animal consumption. Here are a couple ideas I had:

1. **Stop subsidizing the meat industry.** This one is super obvious. With the availability of meat alternatives like beyond/impossible meat, if the meat industry stops being subsidized, people will start buying meat alternatives simply because they‚Äôre *cheaper*. Those companies will then be able to scale up and potentially bring their prices down even more, causing a positive feedback loop.

2. **Require FDA vegan/vegetarian labels on all products that meet the requirements for being vegan/vegetarian.** When people see products advertising themselves as vegan or vegetarian in stores, they often won‚Äôt buy them, because internally their thought process will be ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not a vegan/vegetarian, those products aren‚Äôt for me‚Äô. But if those labels are put on *all* foods, that won‚Äôt be the case. People aren‚Äôt going to order French Fries from Wendy‚Äôs, see the FDA vegan sticker, and think ‚Äòguess I can‚Äôt eat these‚Äô. They‚Äôre going to eat them and then they‚Äôre going to get used to the idea of eating vegan food, while also gaining a better understanding of what is and is not vegan. Meanwhile, companies will also try to meet the requirements for those stickers in borderline situations, because marshmallow producers(for example) aren‚Äôt going to want to publicly advertise that they *aren‚Äôt* vegetarian. That raises all kinds of questions in your average consumer. Finally, people will realize just how many non-animal based options they actually have, where they otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have thought about it.

I think there are many other policy changes that could help fight normalization. Let me know if you have any other ideas in the comments.",vegan

You can see this in action [here](https://youtu.be/DxRsLI6K7hg?si=hY-tg0iV9S6Lq-iZ&t=161). I'm starting to hear this from carnists in normal conversations about Veganism.

I very rarely see Vegans give a truly effective answer to this, so I thought I'd give mine, as it seems to work well:

""I don't eat any more avocados and almonds than I did when I used to eat meat, and neither do other Vegans I know. The reason is that nobody is replacing meat with avocados and almonds, but rather with things like tofu, seitan, and beans, which have far lower environmental impacts than even the lowest-impact animal product. Sure, many people (both Vegan and non) drink almond milk. I personally prefer Soy and Oat because they have the lowest environmental impact. It's great you care about the environmental impact of avocados and almonds. If you care about that, then you should absolutely care about the impact of animal agriculture, are you aware of the environmental cost of meat and dairy?""

Simple, prevents them from calling you a hypocrite, praises them for caring (which psychologically makes them more open to your side), and ends with a question that forces them to think.

It's not a news to be vegan because many people are and it is more accepted nowadays. 

I turned vegan because of ethical and environmental reasons. I mostly brainwashed myself because I realized I couldn't keep eating meat. 

These days I remembered a convo with an ex about veganism, and it is so weird that I still remember it. I looked in messenger then and I found out that I was saying all the typical things meat eater says:

- the nutrients
- the B12
- free range chickens give nutritious eggs(what does that even mean, completely unrelated to the point)

So the thing is I was mentally closed despite having tried vegetarian options and despite telling myself I was so smart. 

Now at the time I was alao super worried about the climate and other people weren't,so I don't know why I was so closed. 

I feel really cringey about it and also I'm doubting my openess, I am not sure how many other things I'm not open about and it is making doubt my life a bit. 

Also I'd love to have a convo with this person but so many years have passed and I am in a relationship now (with a meat eater that use other excuses). So maybe it is a bad idea, right? 

I don't want to be like I was, i really hope that while growing up my brain is changing and I'm more open and sensible, because I don't want to be that close with people, I want to learn and understand where I'm being an hypocrite or where I am not really listening. It is scary.

I've decided that every week I'm going to post on each of my social media accounts about how abused animals are just to satisfy our taste buds. I honestly don't care who removes me or dislikes me for it because my true friends know how much this effects me. Probably not the best approach, I know. I'm just mad and tired of sitting back.

One parent has cut-out dairy at home but still eats meat and eggs at home, + dairy, meat and eggs at restaurants; the other parent hasn't made any lifestyle changes at all. I've lost a lot of respect for the latter parent because they, like so many others, believe their taste buds to be more important than preventing the suffering of animals. I've even made so many delicious vegan meals for them that they LOVED! I just don't get it.

Reproduction - evil. Any positive experience - is a diminishment or relief from a negative. In other words, pleasure - is a diminishment of pain. For example, you will not get a pleasure from drinking water if you‚Äôre not thirsty. If you have thirst - you are suffering, feeling a discomfort. Desires - are the sources of pain.
 2. The world has huge problems: predation, parasitism, diseases, misery, etc. 
 3. Suffering - is the only thing that matters, and if it seems to you that there is something other important except suffering , that is because that thing influences the amount of suffering. For example, food seems to people as an important thing, but it is because food helps them to satisfy desire of eating - hunger. And people will not consider a little rock, from billion light years from here, as an important thing, and it is right because that rock does not influence the amount of suffering at all. That is why suffering is equally bad regardless of who exactly suffers.
 4. There is no proof of the existence of God, on the contrary, all the facts indicate the opposite: evolution, the history of the planet, archeology, and most importantly - a huge amount of senseless suffering (for there is nothing reasonable in creating a world in which so much suffering occurs).Therefore, all this is a repeated confirmation that life is created by unreasonable, chaotic events in the world. Life is the result of an unfortunate set of circumstances.

I also seem to have some sort of executive dysfunction, I just cannot do things sometime so meals I can easily throw in the microwave are a lifesaver but most of those contain sugar so I wouldn't be able to eat them anymore.

I'm struggling to cut out bone char sugar because of how much of my diet contains it and how many foods would be restricted (no more bread, no juice, no jelly, no cereal, a lot of salad dressings out the window) so it just seems like an insurmountable task.

Went to eat with a best friend and got into an argument yesterday.,39,16g3cuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16g3cuz/went_to_eat_with_a_best_friend_and_got_into_an/,1694457624.0,"Rant/Story.

Backstory: 

I've known my best friend (BF) for over 20 years and our mutual friends (MF) for just as long if not longer. We argue as friends do and debate about lots of topics but I made a conscious decision to not talk about the hot topics surrounding veganism with most of my friends. They know my stance on it and they know they can ask questions but I usually just don't ever talk about it first. We usually just discuss food recipes.

Setting: 

My bestie and his wife invited me to lunch at a spot where they serve options for me and we were catching up on our lives and talking about our mutual friends.

Anyway, our MF kennels his dogs and one of the dogs they bought from a puppy mill. When asked about how I feel about that I said simply that they should already know how I feel about it considering my stance on animal rights and I left it at that.

As I was talking about how MF kennels his dogs for hours at a time my BF is getting visibly upset and starts saying he's pissed that he does that etc. But most importantly ""may cost them a friendship if he speaks up to MF about it because it will make him *that* angry. That's such a horrible thing to do to a pet.""

Me: ""I have to pick and choose my battles for sake of friendships and I cant say MF and his wife are ""bad people"" because they kennel their dogs. Because then I wouldn't have any friends.""

BF: ""Yeah but they are pretty bad for this. And it is terrible but what do you mean you wouldn't have any friends?""

Me: ""Well, what I mean is if I hated them for that, then imagine how much I would not only hate them but all my friends including you and wife here, for continuing to buy and consume animal products...""

BF: ""They aren't the same thing.""

Me: ""Agreed. The latter is worse.""

BF: ""No, these are pets. The other animals are not.""

Arguments:

We went on the back and forth for an hour and a half and his arguments were attempts justifying consuming animal products were some of the same cliche ones we hear over and over but he also said the following:

Non factory farms exist and treat their animals better or ""ethically"". * we've all heard this a million times.

Dairy cows want to be milked.

I've seen Dominion but that's to the extreme although I agree factory farming is terrible but thats why there is No factory farming options as they are better for the welfare of the animal.

Rescued dairy cows are going to die because they are no longer milked(?) *I don't understand this one at all but my guess is it's handwaving away responsible practices for rescuing cows and it's ""actually worse for them because now they will die by not being milked. So you're causing them more harm.""

Pets are friends and animals even dogs are commodities and food. I.e he has no issues with dogs eaten in other parts of the world because they are no longer pets at that point. They are food.

PETA *need I say more? 

Environmental argument that somehow got around to quoting Carl Sagan saying something about how we need some emissions and cows producing them serves that purpose(?) Again not sure what this was about.

Conclusion: 

In the end I told him while I agree about the kenneling being awful it's much worse for every animal sticking cages their short lives and if he doesn't care about animals aside from them being his pets then there is no point in trying to convince him otherwise. I can't make someone care. But I can call them out for it being obtuse and even a little hypocritical. Because they want to hate for kenneling but not for doing the things they and most ""animal lovers"" do.

I'm not great at arguing with friends because I get emotional easily because I have invested my life with them. I mess up facts and stifle my words and I can't remember stats like he can so it gets to the point where I just get too upset to talk. 

And then the next day I all of a sudden remember everything and making great points and convincing arguments in my head. I have those ""fuck I should've responded this way and said this thing"" moments and then I kick myself.

I love my friends and try to remember that I was like this at one point but my friends are much more educated than I am and smart but it just makes me so disappointed. I don't have any vegan or vegetarian friends so that compounds the feelings.

My brother spent the afternoon trying to find a fault in my reasoning despite accepting veganism as a smart solution for most of the problems,2,16gndak,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16gndak/my_brother_spent_the_afternoon_trying_to_find_a/,1694513323.0,"I think I convinced my brother to go Vegan even if he's struggling with certain aspect but he was quite open minded about it after I showed him the research and also the useleness of killing animals when we can get all the nutritions from plants.  


With him I don't use the socratic methods, so I just tell him things how I think and there is no much filter. Maybe I should filter things for him as well even though I always considered him very rational, but of course he also has an emotional side and trying to have a certain style of communication may be still helpful.  


The discussion started because he told me how he was talking to a guy about veganism and he said to him things like ""it's acceptable to eat meat once in a while, we do what we can, we try our best"".   
He said that he used this tactic so that the other person is more open or feels like they have to contradict you so they start defending your initial thesis.   


I told him then that saying things like this it is doing harm because you are just excusing behaviours and that we wouldn't say that it's okay to rape or mistreat black people or slap a woman once in a week rather than 3 times a week. I mean great, you do less harm, but it is still very harmful.  


He started saying that if I say things like this to people, the people will feel judged and that they may say: ""eh, but who are you to say things like this when you are building an house and driving a car?"" basically his argument was that I am not morally perfect so I can't tell him or other people to avoid meat and diary completely.  


The discussion got a bit heated and he started wanting to demonstrate that I think I am morally impeccable and that instead I have to accept that people do not moral things even if conscious like building an house on a land or driving a car. Just because maybe CO2 emissions can be linked indirectly to the death of a person.  


What I tried to say to him is that it is just a line where things can be morally justified or maybe they are not moral but still justifiable. In the absolute term of sense abusing a child is wrong and cannot be accept, eating an animal is wrong, but building an house for me it is not sustainable and can actually make people die, but it is not as morally valuable as eating an animal.  


So basically for me being moral is not doing the abuse and eating animal thing and building an house is morally justifiable, but for him everything is not morally justifiable but certain things are not acceptable and other acceptable.  


At times this seemed like a conflict where one has to show supremacy over the other and I hated this. Because he just wanted to prove that I am not as moral as I think because I will build an house and I can't tell others about the morality of not eating meat.  


I did a mistake during the argument and I said that I do moral action and if I don't do moral action it's because I am unconscious about it, if I become conscious I would stop. To that he replied, but you are building an house and it is not moral, but yet you are doing it.  


To me things are at a different levels, also building an house means having the chance to live on a land and to grow easily food.

I‚Äôve been a Vegetarian all my life and I am slowly transitioning towards a vegan diet. I never really liked milk, cheese or other dairy products. But I just can‚Äôt live without yogurt. I tried of couple of yogurt‚Äôs from whole foods and vegan supermarkets near my house in San Diego. They do not taste good.

When I say yoghurt, I mean the Indian style not the Greek one. As a South Indian, I am used to ending my meals with rice and yoghurt. I feel so guilty consuming it now as that is the only thing hindering me from becoming a complete vegan :( 

If there are any Indians on this group, can you help me with some vegan yogurt recommendations which taste similar to the ones we make using milk at home?

Thanks in advance‚ù§Ô∏è",vegan

Citation: Romero Waldhorn, D., & Autric, E. (2022, December 21). Shrimp: The animals most commonly used and killed for food production. https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/b8n3t 

Summary:

Decapod crustaceans or, for short, decapods[1] (e.g., crabs, shrimp, or crayfish) represent a major food source for humans across the globe. If these animals are sentient, the growing decapod production industry likely poses serious welfare concerns for these animals.
Information about the number of decapods used for food is needed to better assess the scale of this problem and the expected value of helping these animals.
In this work we estimated the number of shrimp and prawns farmed and killed in a year, given that they seem to be the vast majority of decapods used in the food system.
We estimated that around:
440 billion (90% subjective confidence interval [SCI]: 300 billion - 620 billion) farmed shrimp are killed per year, which vastly exceeds the figure of the most numerous farmed vertebrates used for food production‚Äìnamely, fishes and chickens.
230 billion (90% SCI: 150 billion - 370 billion) shrimp are alive on farms at any moment, which surpasses any farmed animal estimate known to date, including farmed insect numbers.
25 trillion (90% SCI: 6.5 trillion - 66 trillion[2]) wild shrimp are directly slaughtered annually, a figure that represents the vast majority of all animals directly killed by humans out of which food is produced.[3]
At this moment, the problem of shrimp production is greater in scale‚Äìi.e., number of individuals affected‚Äìthan the problem of insect farming, fish captures, or the farming of any vertebrate for human consumption. Thus, while the case for shrimp sentience is weaker than that for vertebrates and other decapods, the expected value of helping shrimp and prawns might be higher than the expected value of helping other animals.",vegan

New Vegan group in VR chat,2,16ge90z,https://i.redd.it/cogv4g3jcqnb1.jpg,1694483202.0,"This is kind of a niche thing to post here but I just started a new vegan group in the social game VR chat because the other one in that game won‚Äôt let anyone start group lobbies or see members. This makes it very hard to actually meet the other vegans in the group so I‚Äôm hoping this will help people connect with each other.
If you do join I encourage you to start group+ lobbies so we can all connect with each other, some of us have very few vegan friends and no sense of community so I‚Äôm hoping this helps a few chill people meet each other. I‚Äôve had mixed experiences with vegan discords but I‚Äôve always found VR chat to be a very easy place to socialize. 
Most people don‚Äôt like random friend requests but you should also be able to see all other group members if you‚Äôre desperate, this may change in the future if people get harassed for being vegan or too many random requests or something.

This is an older music group that was repurposed and I can‚Äôt swap pictures or the banner because I don‚Äôt have a premium account/vrc+ so the current pictures are placeholders that are a bit weird. 
Enjoy some vegan lasagna 

For those that don‚Äôt know or haven‚Äôt ever heard of vr chat is like what meta is supposed to be but it works much better and it‚Äôs not extremely commercial like meta. It‚Äôs just a game where you can go talk and hang out with people and is mainly for use with vr headsets. There are lots of games inside of vr chat like mini golf, rhythm games, among us, janky cod style zombies and what not that you can play with friends and plenty of other things to do like online music events or vr raves, watching movies and tv for free, etc. There are also plenty of toxic people and some kind of weird ve culture stuff that‚Äôs normalized so you may want to beware

You don‚Äôt need a vr headset to get on vr chat, you can play on desktop so anyone with an ok computer can try it out. If anyone wants to try VRC and also wants to meet some other vegans to hang out with feel free to join or add me on there personally from the group description, I spend most of my time studying Japanese though.


If you‚Äôd like to join just go to the group tab on the vr chat website or in game and search vegan, you should be able to find it fairly easily but the number for this particular group is in the picture if not. There are only 2 other vegan groups and you shoul join them all!",vegan

**Main part-** For reference, likely gonna be out in smaller towns a lot too. So yeah, just any bits of info would be really appreciated- E.g. What‚Äôs good to stock up on in major stores, words/phrases to be aware of, possible differences in the labeling, anything‚Äôs good :)

Importantly- It seems really rude to turn down food if offered (like the group is around for dinner or whatever). I have little idea how to broach the topic, ask about stuff, or possibly refuse, without coming off as a bad guest. Complex question I know, hardly expect answer, but figured I‚Äôd put it here anyway. If the edibility isn‚Äôt really assured, and worse comes to worst, are there any morally-tolerable lies?/s‚Ä¶mostly lol

On some previous trips, my partner has been trying to mentally note what I can eat there. Once commented that basically most things can be made vegan by just asking for no meat and such, like, not as sneaky with ingredients vs the US/UK? Thought it‚Äôd be best to ask around anyway for people with better awareness/experience with vegan stuff, even just in general on mainland Europe.

Why do vegan restaurants tend to keep making the same business-destroying rookie mistakes?,189,16ex0o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16ex0o5/why_do_vegan_restaurants_tend_to_keep_making_the/,1694342165.0,"It seems like vegan restaurants tend to be less successful that regular restaurants. I've seen most of the ones that go out of business make really basic mistakes. Please add to the list, as I think this is the constructive criticism that we never give to the restaurants we want to see succeed the most.

1. Drastic changes to the menu.
I've even seen a restaurant so stupid that they rotate their menu completely, every week, and now are trying to keep a dead business alive with gofundme compaigns. How about attempting a consistent menu?

2. Changing the recipe. Notoriously, I see this with seitan the most. They change the recipe to cut costs or whatever, it doesn't taste the same, then people stop showing up. No, your new recipe does not taste better. Don't play yourself.

3. Stop under-charging. Vegans are used to paying a premium. We understand that you'll go out of business if you don't charge an extra ~ $5 per entre.

4. Stop offering things that don't sell. While it seems nice, there's no way small restaurants just starting out can eat the food waste cost from items that aren't selling. Get rid of them.

5. Expanding too quickly. Non-vegan restaurants are beginning to offer vegan options, often putting vegan restaurants at a disadvantage. Try expanding to just one location at a time instead of 2-3. And pick a place where other restaurants nearby are unlikely to offer the same foods.",vegan

I'd like to include sections to give more information about: fish and their capacities, proper fish care, fish rescue, aquatic veterinary care, how to adopt a fish, how to remove fish from your diet, etc. 

I'd also like to have a homepage with background about the sanctuary, an overview of why we should care about fish, and how to support the sanctuary through donations, etc.

Recently I got into a discussion with my vegan dad about the latter - I told him that bookie x is giving this promo and that the odds on horse y aren't too bad so that this is definitely a bet that makes you money on average, and hence the bookie loses money on this bet, on average. He believed me that it was a good bet but said he doesn't bet on horses, out of principle.

I was just kind of surprised - I would of course think that betting on horses in most cases isn't vegan, as bookies make money and you're supporting the industry, but if you find a bet that loses the bookies money surely you're doing the opposite of supporting the industry?

While they may have received some derision for throwing paint on fur-wearing celebs, their activism seemed to have some broader appeal and they almost certainly contributed to the major decline of fur jackets as a status symbol. PETA have kept up their campaigns into the social media age, but despite the gradual increase in the popularity of veganism since that time it seems that their detractors have only grown louder.

Im sure you've all seen the intense hate that PETA receives on Reddit whenever they're mentioned, but I was not aware until a few years ago that PETA has been the subject of an ongoing astroturf campaign by the Centre for Consumer Freedom (unsurprisingly funded by big ag). Since then I have tried to bring up this info whenever I see negative comments, but the amount of pushback I get for even suggesting that PETA might not be a terrorist organization hellbent on personally murdering everyone's pets is insane. I'm no stranger to defending unpopular opinions, but the foaming-at-the-mouth that occurs at the mere mention of their acronym could fool me into believing I'm being deliberately targeted by CCF bots. 

All that is to say, while PETA is a vegan organization I'm not even sure how they're viewed by the broader vegan community. While they undoubtedly do good work (i.e. the recent discovery of monkey labour in Thai coconut plantations) I'm curious to see whether other vegans support their brand/messaging and think there is value in defending them, or whether it would be more effective to rebrand them into a new organization without decades of fake press hanging over them.",vegan

Has being vegan changed how you view ‚Äúbad‚Äù people?,149,16ej17b,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16ej17b/has_being_vegan_changed_how_you_view_bad_people/,1694298920.0,"This might be controversial here but I don‚Äôt think humans are bad. I just think we‚Äôre just animals too. Some are empathetic, some are more individualistic, others just don‚Äôt think critically about some of their actions and live on autopilot.

Politics for example.

I‚Äôve met other left wing people who couldn‚Äôt be friends with a conservative. ‚ÄúHow could I enjoy the company of someone who is against abortion/gay marriage?‚Äù It‚Äôs all very black and white. Good guys and bad guys. 

Meanwhile almost everyone I love, my parents, friends, my own son when he visits his dad, eats the bodies of innocent creatures that suffered unnecessarily. 

If I cut off anyone with whom I disagreed, I‚Äôd be very lonely.

The thing is, the empathy I feel extents to any being capable of experiencing suffering, including those humans. If you were raised in a religious home and so you hold certain views, ok, we disagree but we can still bond over other things we have in common. Perhaps we agree on other social issues, like opposing war. Perhaps we share past experiences or hobbies. 

Being a vegan is fucking lonely if, because they‚Äôre meat eaters, the rest of society is your enemy. But if you realise that humans are animals too, with flawed logic, different experiences that shaped their views and actions, it feels a lot less isolating. 

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not keen on the word carnist/carnism being used to describe all non vegans. It‚Äôs rather divisive. I mean it fits for people like piers Morgan and people who comment ‚Äúbacon‚Äù on everything. But most non vegans are just on autopilot doing what they‚Äôve always done. It‚Äôs not a pro-animal-suffering ideology. Most of us vegans who were raised as omnivores have been there in the past so it‚Äôs not hard to see. 

Thoughts?

Edit: I feel like there‚Äôs some misunderstanding, when I refer to politics I don‚Äôt mean we should befriend people that are extremely right wing, racists and homophobes. I was thinking more where it‚Äôs not clear cut. For example, the parents of my kids friend are a mixed race couple who are immigrants and not well-off. So not privileged or bigots. More likely to be the ones discriminated against by the bigots. But they are catholics who don‚Äôt agree with abortion. Do you see what I mean? I am pro choice but wouldn‚Äôt agree with elective late term abortions. Am I a bigot? 

I just just think it‚Äôs not as simple as group A = bigots/bad guys and group B = oppressed/allies/good guys. Being vegan makes that hit home.",vegan

When I drink the amount that was enough for me to get tipsy a month ago, now I'm feeling completely sober. I also can drink significantly more now without getting any hangover in the morning. And it's not about that I drink very often, I actually started drinking less in the last couple of months due to various reasons (that do not include physical health promblems though). If you need particular numbers: I drink 1-2 times a week, before 250 ml of vodka was enough for me to get tipsy, now I need around 400 ml to get to the same level of drunkiness.

I am not a doctor but from what I can assume, instead of digesting heavy meat foods along with alcohol now my organism can fully concentrate on processing alcohol and increased tolerance is the result.

Everyone in the replies was taking it as a joke. Now imagine if a man did that to a child or someone who hadn't consented to sex, everyone would be outraged and demanding long prison sentences.  Some people even demand a completely innocent man to be punished but a man can literally publicly admit that he raped an animal and no one bats an eye. If it's done to a cow, it's taken as a joke and it's called ""having sex"" rather than rape.

Rape is something that most humans consider to be a very serious crime. Some even think it's worse than murder because rape is never necessary. However, when it comes to animals, rape is apparently fully justified. Carnists will say that eating animals is necessary. Now lets assume their opinion is correct, even in that case it should not be fine to rape an animal because that is never something a human needs.

It is undoubtedly true that animals are seen as a commodity that can be abused and exploited. And the so called ""left wingers"" are always quiet about this. They will want to dismantle hierarchies but never do the same about speciesism. Maybe I am thinking too much about this but it makes me really sad how animals are treated by a majority of humanity.

I love plant based milks,10,16e8dzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16e8dzc/i_love_plant_based_milks/,1694272905.0,"Over the past year, I've made major changes to my diet and am about 85-90% vegan at this point and I have to say, plant based milks are what I love the most about this change. Jesus christ, they are just amazing. This is an appreciation post to plant based milks for having changed my life. I make smoothies, oatmeal, pancakes, and eat cereal on a daily/weekly basis so having an alternative to god awful cows milk was very important. Plant based milks not only delivered, but exceeded all expectations. We can add plant based milks to humanity's greatest creations list. 

Silk's Original Soy is my go to for cereal and smoothies. Im a big fan of 'heavier' smoothies over the juicer/waterier types and Soy is perfect for it. Also just obsessed with the flavor. Soy + frosted flakes is a staple. I use Silk's Original Almond for smoothies too, but also for oatmeal because I've found it to be the best when it comes to giving a sweeter flavor. I recently tried Chobani's Vanilla Oatmilk and the taste wasn't exactly what I was expecting but I did like it, and I think it'll grow on me the more I use it. Planning to make oatmeal with it tonight. The idea of vanilla tasting oatmeal on top of the added sweetness of topped bananas and blueberries is just too good. I did try out the vanilla oatmilk with smoothies and while I enjoyed the taste, it's a lot more watery than I'd like so I'll stick to cooking with it, along with having it in cereal. 

I'm planning to try Chobani's Extra Creamy and Oatly's Full Fat along with Oatly Original, to round it all off. Currently, I've decided to always have Silk's Original Soy/Almond on hand and I'll make the decision regarding which oat milk will be the staple going forward.

Most people care about animals and the environment but don't make the connection to the food they eat. Even if they do, they find it hard to find reasonable vegan options when dining out.

I want to make a platform like HappyCow but for the general population. Where HappyCow caters to people who already intend to eat more plant-based and explicitly filter vegan options, I want to make a platform for people in general that may want to reduce their personal carbon emissions, and who might also have other preferences (e.g. religious, allergies, tastes, etc.).

The idea is that I can search in natural language something like ""Alice and I want to have dinner on Saturday"". The system knows I'm vegan, what my schedule is, what foods we both like, the reviews we've left, which places we've saved in our lists, location preferences, etc., and can recommend and help book a restaurant.

The long term vision is that I should be able to walk into a restaurant as a customer and sit down, and my food just comes to me. Because my system knows I'm trying to reduce my carbon emissions and it knows what food I like, and maybe I've given it some more context like how I'm feeling, it can recommend the best vegan dish and place the order.

Users don't pay for anything - it's quite like a social network - restaurants and others will pay.

Venting - Argument about pets,0,16ersl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16ersl6/venting_argument_about_pets/,1694323645.0,"Throwaway because I don't want my main account to be discovered by anyone who recognises this situation. This is just a description of a scenario that I feel has broken a long term friendship.

TL;DR: I want to rescue a dog and I feel as though my friend has no respect for me.

&#x200B;

I've been vegan for around 7 years. I'm child and pet free. My wife and I have always wanted to rescue a dog, but up until recently we've been apprehensive about feeding them meat and whether our lifestyle can make room for the the life they deserve.

&#x200B;

I've been open to the idea of feeding a dog a plant based diet for a few years, but I wasn't very confident that they could thrive. The research up until recently has been quite low quality, mostly through pet guardian self-reporting. In 2021-2022 research seemed to drastically increase and a systematic review was released earlier this year - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36669053/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36669053/). This has been posted on this subreddit before, so you can look for that post if you like. The only remaining concern is whether the dog would adapt well to a plant based diet, I think many rescued dogs are set in their ways and have enough stress without changing their diet.

&#x200B;

My wife and I (both vegan) were out for dinner with some friends (neither vegan), and one of them inquired whether we're going to rescue a dog soon. I said that I think we are. She asked whether I'd feed a pet vegan food, so I said yes, the latest research shows that there's no real negative health outcomes for them so I'm a lot more comfortable with it. I explained the current situation of the research so she could understand my position better. I also pointed out that her cat food's taurine mostly comes from a synthetic source because the natural taurine breaks down, and that cats on plant based food generally have higher levels of taurine.

We've gone through this conversation a few times now, and I've always perceived her to be immediately hostile about the topic, even though I consider us all to be very close friends. I think I'm quite well educated on veganism by this point, and I find it unreasonable for a non-vegan to lecture a vegan on animal ethics without any sound arguments, so I react quite abruptly. For example I've pointed out that I'm not the one who eats animal products every day, including clearly highly sentient animals like octopus. I try to bring the argument back to the facts we have available to us, but it's an entirely emotional discussion that I can't reason my way out of.

It got very heated very quickly. She asked me whether I believe everything I read online, whether I've ever owned a dog before (we have, so what?), and commented to my wife that it's clear we're not ready to ""own"" a pet.

These things might not sound very insulting but she knows me well and I've taken this personally - she knows I try to be as logical possible, that I try not to make claims without sound arguments or evidence to support them, and if I'm unsure about anything I say I try my best to make that clear.

I was hoping she wouldn't be hostile again, but it seems as though it's going to be an ongoing thing, so I'd rather just avoid contact with her.

Some side notes about my expectations:

I'm happy to buy every brand of vegan dog food that exists and let the dog figure out what they want to eat. I'm unsure whether there's a possibility for them to reject them all. A friend suggested I foster dogs to find one that can make the change, but I don't want to risk the dog rejecting all of the options and being expected to provide it with meat. If that's a possibility then I'll have to abandon the idea.

I'm undecided on whether it's unreasonable to rescue a dog and then try to force them to make the change. I suspect some dogs would starve themselves, which I don't want to be part of. But on another hand if it was an infant I'd be entirely comfortable with providing them with a nutritionally complete diet that excluded animals, and I wouldn't compromise. I wonder whether non-vegans consider whether the dog they rescue will reject all of the food they provide?",vegan

I simply couldn't understand it as a child in an intuitive sense. Most animals get weaned off their mother's breast milk. No mammal gets weaned and then starts drinking the bodily fluid of another species. When a mama cow is feeding their baby calf, that's growth milk to grow a baby calf, not a baby human.

When I addressed this concern as an eight-year-old child to older adults, they looked at me like I'm crazy or like I'm just a child so I don't know what I'm talking about.

Horizon Organic Milk question- are they hiding anything?,0,16ebfbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16ebfbs/horizon_organic_milk_question_are_they_hiding/,1694280465.0,"I have been vegan for a few months now, for solely ethical reasons, as this actually may have a detrimental effect on my health as I am NOT good at eating a balanced diet and in fact I have basically been falling back on processed vegan foods for now and eating like the same things every day with no variety because executive function in general can be a struggle for me. My parents are concerned about my health, and with my current habits they probably have good reason to be.

My mom is trying to convince me to at least introduce milk back into my diet, to hold off at least some kinds of nutritional deficiencies. I told her no, because of the horrible things that I have seen footage of happening in the dairy industry, but then she sent me a website for a company called Horizon Organic Milk. Looking through some of their pages, they at least make it LOOK pretty good‚Äî they talk about how they like to prioritize wellbeing of the cows over amount of milk produced, how they let them walk free and have cow brushes they love to rub against and how they periodically have inspectors come to make sure they're holding up to their ethical standards.

However, of course the website doesn't mention anything about... what happens to the cows once they get past a peak age... although I did find this about sickness... I find it weird that they don't like to use antibiotics by the way... but I don't see any explicit mention of cruelty.

*""* *What happens if a cow gets sick on an organic farm?*

*We take care of her! But we do our best to prevent illness in the first place and keep cows healthy with quality organic pasture grazing, high-forage diets, low-stress birthing, regular veterinary checkups, freedom of movement, and clean living conditions. These are all part of preventive health care. When a calf or cow does become ill, we rely on natural and alternative methods as our preferred treatment. The use of antibiotics is strictly prohibited, so if a sick animal cannot be restored to full health with organic-approved treatments, we may administer antibiotics or other prescribed synthetic medicines. However, when antibiotics or other prohibited materials are administered, the animal is no longer considered organic and is permanently removed from the herd. We always consider the well-being of our animals first and never allow an animal to suffer.""*

I do wonder what ""permanently removed from the herd"" means... I really hope they don't mean slaughter... but I couldn't find more info about it.

I'm wonder if I somehow need to find a way to visit one of their farms, if they allow it that is.

But does anyone here happen to have info about this company?

I really don't want to drink milk from them if they're lying about how they treat the cows. But if they were telling the truth, then it sounds like it would not be that unethical.

But I figured that if there is anyone that could show me evidence they're lying, if it exists, it would be here.",vegan

Would you use this wool yarn from the farmers market? Or leave it be because it comes from an animal, but it‚Äôs not food consumption at the same time and not causing the animal any harm? Again also not breeding just to make more wool?

I was contacted by a classmate, she had seen vegan info on my fb page and was inquiring if I had any business ideas, I shared some and she liked most of them and said she knew the person to do this and we sat down and brainstormed. I was the only vegan so they picked my brain. I was looking over the pourpose and the genuinity or the idea. They said anything we make we split it by 3, after paying the costs of production and I did most of the know how, and talking to clients as I was the only vegan in the project. The vegan clients were very angry and coming to me telling me this people were shit people, I could I see it, I thought it was amazing to involve non vegans s on a vegan bubble and that this will transition them sooner or later , the project went well, it was a small event and They said the money was a total loss, we all comisioned a bit on our own sales so I got some money out of it, tho the whole experience and meeting all this vegan new friends was amazing! I was proud and content. So this is where it gets tricky. My friend said the girl we were hiring to manage the sound and set up was not the creator but a logistics allie, and then next year or six months from that time the girl that did the logistics and sound basically said she was planning a second edition so we can discuss it over cheese and wine. To that I opposed, gave her the explanation no way we were having cheese st this meeting, and she took that as now I can see as a on purpose planned excuse to leave me out. I never took myself out she just continued without me. The other teammate left to another country. So next year the other girl says from abroad she wants to do a new one but better and that this other person, some how got the fb admin and not only kicked her out of the admin but legalized the brand. Ok so the non vegan person that was alleged hired to do the sound took the fb page, took the name and made it legal and whatever. I was like. Ok more vegan experiences this is amazing yes let‚Äôs do it. And omg it was not ok. Because this idiot person was not vegan and she started this enemy rivalry to the other person. I was like. Ok wow. So vegans were choosing sides. So I wrote my truth in a fb group. And then I got a call. The call was from the sound girl saying part of the due diligence was registering the name and that the other girl not only did not tell me but she stole 14k USD from the initial event and she did it make trouble and had to pay from her own pocket to all the people that were hired to work on the logistics. That she noticed it was. Good deal, the other girl lied to me snd used me as the vegan puppet and the sound girl took the name and the fb admin. So then 10 years pass. To this this other girl is like telling me I am the creator and that I get all access and free and I can do whatever I want because it‚Äôs my event. So now it‚Äôs 10 years later. Now I can see she really banked. Not vegan pretends to be vegan. And to finish off the story she just got an article on a magazine that I am not reading just yet, title calls her the creator of the event. Did it take me 10 years to care or notice this Bs! ü§Æ

For a bit of background, they grow lots of barley which is used for whiskey, and to a lesser extent, animal feed. They also have a few animals and some of these are treated entirely as pets (these ones will not be killed or exploited). The animals which do get killed are sold first, so 'out of sight, out of mind'. They have also kept birds but recently have really struggled with having to do some of the killing themselves, and are reconsidering what types of farming they continue with in future.

They are both good people but they are not going to turn vegan any time soon. I think it's likely that they won't continue with raising birds, so they might be looking for an alternative. It may be that they find an alternative which is another case of 'out of sight, out of mind', where there is still exploitation, but I want to know if there are good options I can suggest for them which have no animal involvement at all.

This is in the UK. Anyone know what kind of government incentives there are for plant-based farming?

Does our subreddit need more rules?,23,16cqiux,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16cqiux/does_our_subreddit_need_more_rules/,1694120873.0,"Hey guys I've been on this sub for five years and just a 10 year vegan make a post deciding to leave the community for being subjected to toxic interactions and this makes me think about where our community is in its stage of development which I want to talk about here. 

I think when combining a degree of anonymity with anything social then it needs to have a set of highly strict rules that help enforce and maintain a code of conduct, take online 12 Step meetings for example, otherwise the order and orginal intent of having the community in the first place begins to devolve rather quickly. I think our community just needs more rules to keep us all in line, it wasn't but like 5 years ago this place only had like 200k subs. Call it growing pains I guess, I have faith we will somehow come together to do a better job.

What rules do you guys think would be a good addition?

I think a good rule would be to forbid responding to non-vegan posts, which is against the rules anyway, as well as forbid responding comments from non-vegans which seek to create an argument or debate at all, there is the community r/DebateAVegan for this. I think this would be for the best because not every vegan wants to or is mentally fit for debates. People will default to think that they need to debate with a non-vegan just because they are first to read a post or comment and end up being the hypothetical worst person to do so by ending the debate harshly with bad manners. Not only would the non-vegan gain a bad impression of the community but the vegan that sucks at debates continues to think it is their responsibility to keep up the service to their community and they stay on the defensive to respond to other non-vegans likely how that all just went down. Just my 2 cents.

MODs, if you are in need of more volunteers for moderating the sub then I would be interested to help and I am sure others would be too.",vegan

The Church of Vegan: Recognizing Veganism as a Religion for Legal Protection,11,16crdbc,https://i.redd.it/h2ghtmgkkwmb1.jpg,1694122703.0,"Hello, r/vegan community,

I'd like to share an interesting idea with you all: the ""Church of Vegan"" and how it might help us gain legal protections.

**What is the Church of Vegan?**
Think of it as an assertion that veganism is a religion in its own right, deserving of legal recognition. This could provide significant legal protections for us.

**Why Does It Matter?**
1. **Legal Safeguards:** Asserting veganism as a religion would shield us from discrimination and ensure fair treatment, much like other recognized religions.

2. **Strength in Unity:** By coming together, we can advocate more effectively for animal rights, environmental concerns, and ethical living, just as religious groups do.

3. **Supportive Community:** It would provide a community where we can connect and strengthen our beliefs, much like religious congregations.

**What Can We Do?**
Let's start discussions, share this idea, and raise awareness about the potential of recognizing veganism as a religion for our legal protection.

Imagine a future where our compassion for animals and the environment is legally respected and protected.

Let's have a conversation about how we can work towards securing our rights and recognition. üå± #ChurchOfVegan #LegalProtection",vegan

ALA: 0.5%

EPA: 3.5%

DPA: 0.6%

DHA: 3.2%

Total EPA+DHA: 6.7%

This is beyond expectations. I've been basicly trying ALA + Turmeric + Pepper and it seems to work. Typical results for vegans consuming ALA would be right around 0.6% ALA/1.2% EPA/3.5% DPA/3.3% DHA. The higher DPA can be due to no conversion to DHA being possible, but it could also just be used as a storage mechanism for DHA/EPA. It's unknown whether high DPA has health benefits comparable to high EPA or DHA. It could be that health-wise, the higher EPA doesn't matter, however, afaik, research currently confirms only health benefits for higher EPA and DHA.

I will continue upping my n-3 intake and see if anything changes. Perhaps these results are a fluke. I have never seen n-3 blood profiles like this in any research paper or profiles posted online. They're always high in EPA+DHA+DHA or low in EPA+DHA and high in DPA. High EPA, low DPA and low DHA is new to me.

I've seen carnist sympathizers in some posts on here, I've seen people use language like ""Stop making us look extreme/militant"" (ironically), and I've witnessed how apologetic some of the Reddit vegans are towards non-vegans' reasons to eat animals and their secretions. I've also seen welfarist vegans using reduction of suffering verbiage instead of lives being robbed and rights violations cited. This frustration permeates me because I don't think utilitarianism is conducive to fighting for animal rights. 

Pick-Me Vegan statements (paraphrased)
Example 1: ""You can't preach to them about animals all the time. Sometimes you gotta win them over with delicious food."" 
Example 2: ""You're making us look extreme/bad optics, bro. It can't always be about animal exploitation and cruelty. You harm the animals by doing this poor approach.""
Example 3: ""Backyard eggs are fine to eat if you're vegan. You *rescued* them, so no harm no foul, right?""
I could go on, but I'm sure you get the idea. As an activist, this is shameful behavior from those that should care about animal rights, NOT welfare. We need to be advocates and voices for these innocent animals who are slaughtered by the trillions. We need to include the VICTIM'S perspective when doing outreach or having a conversation. Whenever you pick-me's exclude the animal's perspective, these non-vegans won't register in their minds that it is important enough to care about. I always prefer to ask carnists, ""How would you feel if you were in their position?"" This gets their brain going and their conscience opened up. So please, enough of the tone policing and shaming of how some of us do activism.

I posted about me taking the Liberation Pledge on here, and OMG, the amount of nay-saying for the ""mistake"" I made was unreal. I cannot imagine how these interactions would go IRL. I couldn't understand why people within the community chose to ridicule and insult me for taking a pledge that seeks to liberate animals. I never understood why I was met with that energy instead of some solidarity/emotional support. 

I know for a fact that there are some health ""vegans"" on this subreddit, too. I'm in the camp that says you're not vegan, you're just plant-based dieters. I'm betting you all (PBDs) are probably still buying leather products, not signing animal testing petitions, or have the occasional cheat day like eating dairy cheese or honey.

For those who are ""vegans"" for the environment, I can understand that if the reason is tied to protecting the wildlife and preserving biodiversity so that these animals have a space to exist. However, it must be about the animals and their rights. You shouldn't use a ""sustainability tho"" argument to justify your position because what's sustainable is not always what's moral. No exceptions to this. 

Let's stand together and show the world that there must be accountability and justice for these innocent victims above all else. Health and environment are only bonus benefits. The best benefit is no longer being the reason they are abused, tortured, and killed.

What do you guys think? (I already know some of y'all are going to criticize, and that's fine, just keep it civil).

EDIT: Apparently I need to clarify something since some commentators are nit-picking and taking my words out of context. Mainstream media construes veganism as a DIET when it is not. We, as vegans, need to debunk this myth. Veganism is and always will be an ethical stance, a lifestyle, and a philosophy. If you don't agree, then you don't understand the importance of definitions clearly. Also, I'm not ""shaming"" anyone or being an ""asshole"" for wanting consistency on this. I'm not even angry at the pick-me vegans or the PBDs. I'm so glad people are choosing to become plant-based at least. That still does wonders and saves animals, so why would I be mad about that? I'm just mad about more nuanced takes in this subreddit, and I don't expect a newly converted vegan to understand. This issue is complex.",vegan

Yet I ignored it for so long, was it dissonance, and gluttony? Is it greed and ignorance? Some good flavour? Is that good flavour worth the pain and suffering, torture no matter how well they get treated? Should we pay to continue that?
Killing a dog would be crazy, so why can we kill so many other animals? There‚Äôs no difference. 
Yet being vegan will be viewed as radical, unnecessary.

Imagine being forcefully fed, raised to obesity, to being abused, physically and mentally destroyed, to survive all that, just to be murdered in the end like it‚Äôs nothing. Are these animals really nothing more than food on a plate and a no.tag?

How can you murder an animal, forced. No consent, pretty sure that animal wanted to live and not be killed and eaten. While it‚Äôs completely unnecessary, we do it anyway? Hmmm, let‚Äôs stick your female friends and family members in a box, milk them and rape them to make babies til they are frail and old, to then be killed, babies taken away no matter what. Have your homies and you locked up, fed way too much, only a few months that resemble freedom if you‚Äôre lucky. To be milked for insemination and then slaughtered. Sounds like a good life to you yeah?

Do these animals not have feelings, intelligence, family, social bonds, like a dog or cat could? Like we could? How can we still eat meat and animal products with all this out there? I‚Äôll never forgive myself for the time I have, so it‚Äôs all the more reason and motivation to keep this up now.

Id rather eat my own arm or starve than murder one more innocent being. I‚Äôm adhd af yet the one thing I‚Äôll never forget is shit like this, dominion, earthlings, I want to be vegan for the rest of my life. Take that to the grave type stuff.

Whether that‚Äôs for eggs, meat, milk, fish. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Have some empathy, think critically, further than; ‚Äúfood is good and we‚Äôve eaten meat for thousands of years‚Äù or ‚Äúlions eat meat to survive too‚Äù or ‚Äúplants have feelings too‚Äù - last one for the usually provocative antitards. 

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and choices, but just give it a thought why dontcha. I don‚Äôt judge no one else but myself for this, so please don‚Äôt feel judged by me. Let yourself be judged by you.

The more I think about it the more cemented it gets and I hope it‚Äôll stick forever. I‚Äôm still super sad about how friends and especially family aren‚Äôt really aren‚Äôt open for it, always ready w the standard arguments to warrant eating animal products as a good thing. It feels futile to discuss it, especially my dad is so close minded. Lumps together vegan, lgbtqia+, left and progressive stuff together as woke, super frustrating but i don‚Äôt want to give up. 
I hope one day I can get thru.

Anyway that‚Äôs the story, rant. Any advice would be great. I‚Äôm still in the honeymoon phase, but it‚Äôs a healthy amount of euphoria being able to pick what I eat. Without animals being involved.

I must admit that I'm very ill-informed about the health aspects of a vegan vs non-vegan diet. However, I recently came across Mic the Vegan, a youtuber who makes content on veganism and this got me thinking.

I remember for a long time considering veganism for moral reasons, but I was always too scared to take a look at the animal cruelty videos that people were talking about. Now to me it's time I take a look at where my food could come from and take some form of accountability.

If any of you know some video's I should see, I wouldn't mind if you'd send them to me privately or if you would tell me where I can see them. I know it might be painful to watch, I know I might see horrible things, but I think I should see anyway.

Lastly I was hoping some of you would have some advice on how I could start eating less meat. For information I still live with my parents and they cook dinner.

You can easily grow enough food to live off the land.

As part of the treatment I am doing Radioactive Iodine treatment (RAI).

This entails swallowing a pill made of iodine that has been made radioactive, because the only tissue in your body that uptakes iodine is thyroid tissue... or in my case, cancer tissue because my thyroid was removed.

In preparation to the treatment, they want patients to go on a low iodine diet for 2-6 weeks (longer is better).

So that you're as iodine deficient as possible, so that all the cancer tissue takes up the max amount of the radioactive iodine, because otherwise they need to give you multiple rounds and the radiation treatment itself increases your risk of secondary cancers (radiation bad, but not as bad as cancer).

&#x200B;

So my Endocrinologist gave me my diet list, and I noticed it said ""beef, lamb, chicken, pork - limit to 6oz/day"".

Which surprised me because I'd done my research before, and meat has iodine... so I asked about it.

He said: ""Well, it's better if you don't eat any meat at all, but we can't get people to stick to that, so we just tell them to cut down instead.""

Meanwhile they're telling me to not use toothpaste, because it contains trace amounts of carrageenan that I might accidentally swallow... literally a tiny tiny tiny fraction of what even half an ounce of chicken contains... Nevermind beef, which is 5 times as high in iodine as chicken...

So it's assumed that Americans who are preparing to actively EAT RADIATION THAT IS MADE LESS EFFECTIVE IF YOU EAT MEAT BEFOREHAND cannot be counted on to refrain from eating meat for TWO WEEKS, to the point that doctors don't even bother telling them they ought to at least try it...

On one hand, the equipment that I will be making will surely improve the living conditions of animals stuck in factory farms. Since humans won't completely stop eating meat anytime soon, I'm thinking that my job would at least contribute to animal welfare by decreasing their suffering before death.

On the other hand, the outcome of my work would promote factory farming by making this practice easier and more profitable. This seems to encourage factory farming, which is something that I am strongly against.

Question regarding dairy cows and the vegetarian dilemma,3,16bbzar,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16bbzar/question_regarding_dairy_cows_and_the_vegetarian/,1693979254.0,"Before I start, I just want to say that I am a vegan. 

So I've been interested in the vegetarian-vegan dispute for a while. The argument is that consuming dairy is ""a different side of the same coin"" as meat production. Consuming dairy products creates a prolonged suffering of dairy cows until they are killed, etc.   


My question is this: If the demand for meat consumption in the world went down, so much so that there were more cows producing dairy than there was demand for meat from carnists, to the point that there was leftover cows that no longer could produce dairy effectively (5ish years), what would the factories do with the cows? At this point, they gain no benefit from killing them to process them and sell them for their flesh, so they are effectively useless to the factories. Do they just kill them anyways and dispose of them? Are the cows desirable to anyone who may want them for their own farms, such as small farmers that are not a factory?   


The point of the question is to help me understand how not eating meat, but still consuming dairy (vegetarians), still leads to the cows death under the circumstances that meat is being over-supplied and sending a cow to the market would mean no financial gain for the factories. I ask this because I could see a vegetarian argument to this saying something like ""well, I'm not the one killing the cow by consuming its dairy, its the demand for their meat from carnists that leads to the death of the cow. If people weren't eating meat, the factory wouldn't need to kill the cow"". I think it's a bad defense, but I'm curious what the reality of the situation is. A few defenses to this I've thought of are:  


1. The financially ""correct"" thing to do is to just kill the cows anyways - they gain nothing by keeping them alive, and there isn't a market for them in small farmers. 
2. it's both financially ineffective to take the cows to free-roam in the wild somewhere when they could just be killed, as well as there isn't nearly enough land globally to just release tens of millions of new cows into the wild each year anyways.
3. Even if the cows could be released to roam freely somewhere, or they were sold to small farmers for dairy consumption, the effects from the factories would lead to their premature and painful deaths far earlier anyways, thus meaning the dairy consumer effectively killed them. (In this case, it'd hardly be worth it for small farmers to buy the cows in the first place anyways).

Anyways, overall it seems indefensible but I wanted to hear what everyone else thinks about this situation. And if possible, help educate me on the realities of the nature of my question.

Whey based spirits?!,7,16b5w8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16b5w8g/whey_based_spirits/,1693961384.0,"Am currently in New Zealand and have learned that MANY spirits made here are made by distilling whey into alcohol. There's no requirement to label bottles because once distilled it wouldn't cause an allergic reaction. The house [vodka](https://thebondstore.co.nz/products/the-bond-store-kapiti-coast-vodka-1) at my place of work is whey based and I had no clue because you'd only find out by going on their site. The more brands I check the more widespread it seems to be, not just vodka but gins, liqueurs, blended whiskeys etc. 

I have been aware for a long time that dairy/eggs/fish are used as fining agents in beer and wine production and while not always labelled it has become more common to see vegan-friendly labels or declared use of animal products. I don't think I've ever seen vegan labelled on a spirit bottle... Also this isn't dairy being used as a fining agent, it's essentially the core ingredient. 

From the research I've done there are a few brands that are proudly declaring the use of animal products ""wheysky"" for example but tons of brands don't mention it at all. It's really just depressing the amount of digging I'll have to do just to order a cocktail now and be confident it's vegan.

Approach to convincing non-vegans that veganism is a moral obligation.,1,16bcd3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16bcd3k/approach_to_convincing_nonvegans_that_veganism_is/,1693980583.0,"[Warning: Long Post]

I‚Äôve watched many debates between vegan YouTubers (eg. Joey Carbstrong, Earthling Ed) and non-vegans, as well as online discussions between vegans and non-vegans in other places like YouTube comment sections and Reddit. What I‚Äôve noticed is that a lot of vegans just throw in various points about veganism in no particular order, instead of using a systematic, logical approach to show non-vegans that veganism is a moral obligation. 

Even in the better cases when vegans manage to show that the production of meat, dairy and eggs entails a lot of suffering, most non-vegans will still not be convinced that veganism is a moral obligation. Many vegans will then say that it‚Äôs not possible to convince them because they have no empathy. However, this is not the case. No empathy is required to understand that veganism is a moral obligation. 

Here is the approach that I would use. 

_____________________________________

PART 1 (Name The Trait): 

This part is to identify whether the non-vegan you are talking to ‚Äúcares‚Äù about non-human animals (NHA). 

The question can be phrased in more than one way. 

‚ÄúDo you think NHA deserve 
- fundamental rights (not to be exploited and killed unnecessarily) ?‚Äù
- moral consideration ?‚Äù

If they answer yes, we can skip to Part 2. If they answer no, ask them to name the trait. 

[Optional: Ask the previous question in a human context - this can usually be skipped because most people do think humans deserve fundamental rights / moral consideration]

‚ÄúWhat is the morally relevant difference between humans and NHA such that humans should be given fundamental rights / moral consideration but not NHA?‚Äù

The most common response is that humans are more intelligent than the NHA we enslave. I‚Äôm sure most vegans know how to respond to this argument (does that make it okay to enslave / exploit / kill humans with severe mental disabilities who are less intelligent than the average human?) and show that intelligence is not a morally relevant difference. This is the only response I have heard of, but if there are others you don‚Äôt know how to respond to, please let me know. 

Now, it is possible that the non-vegan will just say that they can‚Äôt identify one but they still won‚Äôt give NHA fundamental rights / moral consideration. It is important to note that this is not a valid argument. There are many ways to show this - what I‚Äôd usually say is: 

‚ÄúGranting fundamental rights to one group of sentient beings but not to another group even though there is no morally relevant difference between them is discrimination. For example, I could say that I don‚Äôt grant fundamental rights to women, minority races, people with disabilities, etc. but that wouldn‚Äôt make it morally justified for me to exploit or kill them unnecessarily.‚Äù

So until the non-vegan can name a valid morally relevant difference between humans and NHA, they have to accept that NHA deserve fundamental rights / moral consideration. 

_____________________________________

PART 2 (Logical Link to Veganism): 

First ask something like this:

‚ÄúIs it morally acceptable to
- inflict unnecessary violence and cruelty on NHA?‚Äù
- exploit, abuse or kill NHA unnecessarily?‚Äù

There are probably many more ways to phrase this question, but make sure to include the part about it being ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù. Once Part 1 is completed, the vast majority of non-vegans will answer no to this. If they answer yes, go back to Part 1. 

Then, briefly explain to them how the production of meat, dairy and eggs involves violence / exploitation / abuse / killing / cruelty towards NHA. I won‚Äôt elaborate on this because I‚Äôm sure all vegans are familiar with this. 

Next, let them know that consuming animal products is unnecessary (because appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy and nutritionally adequate for all stages of life). You can do this by bringing up the positions of large nutrition / dietetic organisations. If they claim that you can‚Äôt get enough B12, explain that there are actually some natural plant sources of B12 (though we should still take supplements / fortified foods to be on the safe side) and that most farmed animals are supplemented with B12 anyways. 

Once this is done, the conclusion follows. 

Consuming animal products involves violence / exploitation / abuse / killing / cruelty towards NHA 
‚Äî> Consuming animal products is unnecessary 
‚Äî> Consuming animal products involves unnecessary violence / exploitation / abuse / killing / cruelty towards NHA, which they already agreed is wrong
‚Äî> Consuming animal products is wrong

_____________________________________

PART 3 (Debunking Arguments): 

Most non-vegans will begin to say some anti-vegan arguments / fallacies at this point, so Part 3 is devoted to debunking them. Make sure not to allow the conservation to derail too much in the first 2 parts. I assume most vegans can respond to all anti-vegan arguments, so I‚Äôll leave it at that. 
_____________________________________

If we use this approach properly, I cannot see any way that non-vegans will feel that it is morally acceptable to continue consuming animal products.

We can see that they explicitly in condemn them all, and ask people instead of support only sanctuaries accredited by the GFAS. ([https://www.sanctuaryfederation.org/](https://www.sanctuaryfederation.org/))

\---

Fast forward to today, their articles and focus seem to be different.

All three archived articles above, today all link to one new updated page: ([https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/zoos-pseudo-sanctuaries/](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/zoos-pseudo-sanctuaries/))

entitled ""***Roadside*** Zoos and Other Captive Animal Displays""

There's **very careful** word-choice in this article, any and all previous mention of ""**zoos**"" has been changed to ""**roadside zoos**"", but there's zero mention of AZA accredited facilities (either pro or against). Just that roadside zoos are bad and that accredited sanctuaries are good. So what about non-roadside zoos?

I did some more digging, and found out the following:

* PETA and the AZA teamed up before against roadside zoos ([http://peta.org/aza](http://peta.org/aza))
* PETA wrote a public letter to the US National Park Service in 2018, arguing against facilities accredited by the shady ZAA and instead for them to recognize ""**real accreditation**"" from either AZA or GFAS ([https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Letter-to-Grand-Teton-National-Park-Oswald-Bear-Ranch.pdf](https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Letter-to-Grand-Teton-National-Park-Oswald-Bear-Ranch.pdf))
* PETA wrote another public letter to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation requesting a ban on New York state facilities holding dangerous animals, but **outright requested an exemption for AZA zoos** and GFAS sanctuaries. ([https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-18-PETA-NYSDEC-Dangerous-Animal-Rulemaking.pdf](https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-18-PETA-NYSDEC-Dangerous-Animal-Rulemaking.pdf))

Could it be that the ""extremists"" at PETA have changed their mind? It's odd because nowhere on their newer articles do they actively **encourage** going to AZA facilities, they just don't mention them at all. It's just ""**don't go to unaccredited zoos, go to accredited sanctuaries"".** 

One thing to bear in mind is that SeaWorld is AZA accredited, yet PETA still openly hates them ([https://www.peta.org/category/campaigns/seaworld/](https://www.peta.org/category/campaigns/seaworld/)). So maybe that's why they don't want to say ""all AZA is good"", but I find this new carefully considered word choice from them on this issue interesting",vegan

"Join the movement to save baby chicks from a cruel, unnecessary death.",22,16al4lm,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16al4lm/join_the_movement_to_save_baby_chicks_from_a/,1693911731.0,"BABY CHICKS KILLED FOR BEING ""WORTHLESS"":

Billions of birds face death on the day they are born simply because their lives are not profitable. In the United States, around 260 million male chicks are killed each year. This means around 30,000 freshly hatched chicks every hour.

&#x200B;

Why is this happening? Male chicks cannot lay eggs, and they are not the same breed of chicken used for meat. As a result, these baby animals are deemed worthless by the egg industry and are brutally killed, using extremely cruel techniques.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, all of this is completely legal.

&#x200B;

CHICK CULLING METHODS EXPLAINED:

One commonly used killing method is maceration, in which the animals are transferred to a machine called a grinder and are killed by ‚Äúshredding‚Äù. The birds are alive and fully conscious as their bodies are violently shredded.

&#x200B;

In some parts of the world, shredding chicks alive is not allowed. Yet they may still be burned, crushed, or drowned, as undercover research has shown. Another common method for killing these chicks is by using CO2 gas. This, too, is cruel ‚Äì a recent study found that animals show behavioral signs of suffering during this process. In the U.S., some chicks are also killed by electrocution.

&#x200B;

Whatever method is used, killing newborn baby chicks should be banned.

&#x200B;

An alternative, called ‚Äúin-ovo sexing,‚Äù is currently in development to bring this horrific practice to an end. In fact, France has pledged to outlaw the practice of culling unwanted male chicks by the end of 2021, and the German Agriculture Minister has announced that the culling of day old male chicks will be outlawed from 2022.

&#x200B;

The aim of in-ovo sexing is to prevent male chicks from hatching in the first place: the sex of the embryo is established before the hatching date (in the egg, hence ‚Äòin-ovo‚Äô sexing). The male eggs are removed from incubation early on, so only female chicks emerge from the eggs after 21 days of incubation.

&#x200B;

The routine killing of young and healthy animals has long been unacceptable to animal welfare experts, the general public, and animal protection advocates. Egg products whose production involved male chick culling are still marketed to consumers as ‚Äúhumane.‚Äù With increasing public knowledge and disapproval, the search for alternatives has been intensified. Worldwide, there are various approaches that can make the killing of male chicks a thing of the past.

Please sign the petition to lend your support to a public ban on chick culling.

&#x200B;

The goal is to reach **123,385** signatures, the petition currently has 112,168, we need the movement to expand.

Her argument: 'Everything in moderation' is probably healthier and milk from cows probably has health-benefits that plants don't have. This dairy-industry-sponsored study says that drinking milk is the optimal way to get calcium and be healthier than otherwise.

End of discussion. It drives me up a wall; and when I try to make the moral argument that it's fucked up to abuse someone else's reproductive system (and take their babies away) for food, she shuts down. It's literally the hollow NPC-stare that can go on for a good minute before she excuses herself and leaves to eat a cheese sandwich and add a splash of milk to her tea.

It's so incredibly disheartening. She will barely even talk to me about it anymore because I ""won't say anything new."" And ""we've been over this.""

For those who have experience in vegan debates.,45,16ah1n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16ah1n8/for_those_who_have_experience_in_vegan_debates/,1693897497.0,"Hey everyone! I've been debating in favor of veganism for some time now whilst doing my due diligence to train myself in formal logic. I'm by no means the best at it but I've had a lot of practice this past year and hope to improve.

I'm sure those of you in the debate world are familiar with the classic ""name the trait."" For those of you who are unfamiliar with name the trait, it's basically a way of testing someone's logical consistency. It's an attempt to determine what an individual's values could be that allows them to kill and eat animals but not kill and eat humans. It helps point out potential contradictions in their values (AKA they're not making sense) which would enable someone to perhaps reflect and reassess what their true values are regarding sentient beings. 

I recently asked someone online that I was debating to name the trait but he actively dodged my question for 30 minutes straight. It was a long arduous process but I did eventually manage to get an answer out of him. He said the trait was reciprocity but then he did some mental contortions and probably realized midway that animals can show reciprocity too at times. I made it clear to him that I wasn't trying to trick/trap him. All I wanted was a clear answer to my question.

He probably thought I really was trying to trick/trap him or something even though I was just trying to figure what his values were. It wasn't clear anymore if that was the trait and he started going on some weird tangent. I then wasted another 30 minutes of him going on a tangential monologue whilst still refusing to name the trait.

He then said that I have no peer reviewed data to support that veganism is morally superior...(what in the actual fuck?) I mean..I never even said veganism was morally superior. I told him veganism was the morally preferable option and that I don't like the term superior because it can be very alienating for non-vegans. 

I told him that I was just trying to make the case for him why I think veganism is the morally preferable option but that I can't do that if he doesn't answer any of my questions. For example, if he were to take the path of nihilism then there wouldn't be any point in continuing since nihilists don't value sentient life. I knew he wasn't a nihilist so I even threw the guy a bone and said that he can name more than one trait if he wants to.

He still refused to answer and then proceeded to say ""you cannot get truth from untruth"" and ""you cannot provide proof that veganism is morally superior"" and ""you have no peer reviewed studies showing veganism is morally superior.""

He seemed so focused on not losing to the vegan that he wouldn't even answer simple questions. It's like he thinks everything I asked is to ""set him up"" or ""trap him"" when that wasn't what I was trying to do at all. 

Why the fuck do I even bother...",vegan

We're all affected by the climate after all, though (ha) even people I know who've lost their homes due to climate change-caused flooding still don't care about the environment beyond sorting their recycling. (And they are staunch Democrats and believe in climate change)

I've noticed a troubling trend with leftists, ie to blame corporations entirely for climate change. Therefore, even if they went vegan, it really wouldn't help the environment (though forget about the animals and what they go through, obvs üòî).

And yet if I were to throw some paper into the bin in front of them, they'd rip me a new one for being so terrible, not helping the planet etc etc.

People who recycle 'for the environment' but won't cut out animal products even one day a week.......it's just so frustrating. And let's not forget, recycling has an environmental cost as well, which is why we first say *reduce* (consumption), reuse, and then finally recycle. I remember learning about that as a kid in the 90s, the focus being on the first two, but somehow very quickly recycling became this like amazing thing that's gonna save the planet.

Anyway, from an environmental standpoint, I view people who use 'animal products' (I hate that term üòî) the same as people who don't recycle or drive Hummers. Except (and I'm sure the metrics don't quite line up) if I could only do *one* thing to help the environment (no animal products or never recycle again), I'm pretty sure veganism wins due to the space saved and water saved alone.

I'll stop before I ramble too much more, but I just wanted to share some thoughts I have to that extraordinarily frustrating and overused 'one person's actions don't make a difference' line. I'm trying to refine my 'vegan for the environment' angles, because somehow the suffering of the animals means next to nothing to the majority of people.

Then we could feed this lab-grown human meat to animals if they truly could not exist on a plant-based diet.

Does being a jerk turn people vegan?,146,169s6i6,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/169s6i6/does_being_a_jerk_turn_people_vegan/,1693834495.0,"I‚Äôve seen numerous posts here asking if being nice is actually effective in turning people vegan. The same question needs to be asked about the opposite approach.

Does telling people they are carnists and animal abusers lead to behavioral change? If it works on a few, but alienates far, far more, is that a good approach?

This also begs the question as to whether certain approaches are favored by those who want to make real change, and if other approaches are favored by those more interested in expressing some good ole cathartic rage.

Is this about saving animals or expressing your feelings?

Have you ever met an evangelist for a religious group? While there certainly are fire and brimstone preachers, that is usually saved for the already converted. Missionaries, the ones tasked with recruiting people who are not already part of the church, are overwhelmingly friendly.

Going the other way, many of us are hostile to religion because of overbearing religious figures in our lives. Being overbearing drives many people to rebel against whatever cause is in question. It doesn‚Äôt work.

If our goal is to save animals, here are some strategic thoughts.

1. One on one persuasion is different than running a pressure campaign to change a corporations practices. Likability is a key element of influence. Be nice. This isn‚Äôt about you. It‚Äôs about the animals.

2. Easier asks get more yeses. That‚Äôs why I encourage people to push for vegetarianism (first rung on the ladder) and veganism later. (Dairy cows are also less than 1% of the land animals raised for food, so getting people off meat is an easier first step, gets more yeses and saves the most animals.)

3. Treat this less like an issue of saints vs sinners and more like treating an addiction. Work with people, meet them where they are and forgive backsliding. Provide support and they will often get to the right place.

4. While I am not religious, the Bible says Christ socialized with sinners and washed their feet. Christianity isn‚Äôt my thing, but I‚Äôd say the founders of that movement had some success. Maybe it‚Äôs worth looking at what worked for them. It‚Äôs ok to eat dinner with omnivores (and probably a terrible time to bring up veganism!)

Remember, we are the only line of defense the animals have. It is our burden to study persuasion and influence and to employ best practices.

I said how much it hurt my feelings that he can‚Äôt eat something I was making him for ONE MEAL, especially because he‚Äôs going on a cruise next week where he‚Äôll be eating everything he could want and more.

I asked him if he had neighbours who invited him over for dinner, and they happened to cook religiously (e.g., Jewish, so no pork), would he march over and put a pork roast in the oven while they were still cooking?! Wouldn‚Äôt that be disrespectful, Dad? He agreed it would be.

This morning it just so happened to be a vegan T-shirt from my favorite vegan restraunt that states ""Plant-based Baddie"" on the front. Normally I just wear it around the house because I don't want people's opinions on my lifestyle (that I don't care to hear), but I thought it would be fine to wear to my therapy appointment.

Therapy rolls around and I walk into her office to start my appointment and I sit down. One of the first things she asks about is my shirt. She asked if I was vegetarian, and I told her I was vegan. She inquired about the difference between vegans and vegetarians and I explained the difference. I didn't get deep into it, I really just explained the dietary and moral differences between the two. Nothing I said could even be remotely turned into being judgemental. Due to the reputation we get as vegans, I'm extremely careful about how I word things. Then she asks me if I want people to stop eating animals and I obviously answered yes. Then she laughed at me and responded ""You know people will never stop eating animals right?"" She was clearly offended and defensive over something that SHE brought up. I didn't want her take on my lifestyle, nor did I ask her for her take on the matter. This was also during my therapy session time that I pay for. I don't really understand how she thought that was an appropriate thing to say. 

And based on what she asked me, she seemed to be assuming the worst, as if me being vegan meant that I push my lifestyle on everyone else. I mean sure I wish people would stop unnecessarily harming animals, but my veganism is about MY morals and what I can change. I lead by example and I'm never pushy about it (despite caring a lot about the animal rights movement). Out of our three therapy sessions, I never once brought it up. I really just can't wrap my head around the fact that someone who is supposed to be a non-judgemental third party wants to judge me for my personal morals/beliefs to my face. After that conversation with her, I felt that her tone changed towards me.

As someone who lives in the south I went out of my way to find a therapist that seemed more open minded. Guess I'll have to keep looking. I'm so frustrated with trying to find a good therapist. I'm not sure I'll be going back to her.",vegan

This may sound counter-intuitive, but hear me out. *Anyone can be vegan,* including those that cannot afford or access the foods necessary to consume a 100% animal-free diet, or have a legitimate medical/health issue that makes it not possible.

The definition of veganism is: a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.

That ""seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable"" part is important because it is impossible for *anyone* to exclude 100% of animal products from their lives. There are just some things we currently have no real viable alternative for yet. Some types of necessary medications come to mind as an example.

If you **legitimately** *need* to eat some amount of animal meat to stay healthy due to some medical condition or not being able to access or afford certain plant-based foods, then it would be *impracticable* for you to go completely without eating animal products. The case could be made that you could still be vegan, as long as you were making a reasonable effort to only eat as little animal products as necessary to be healthy, and not eating in excess of that.

Yes, this means that veganism in practice for a wealthy person in California with no medical/health restrictions will look very different for veganism for a poor person in a developing country with medical/health restrictions and without regular access to grocery stores, but it's important to note that even though one might be eating some amount of animal products out of necessity, **they are both vegan** as long as they are both avoiding contributing to animal exploitation and cruelty to the extent that they are able given their circumstances.

*Anyone can be vegan.* To claim otherwise is to exhibit a soft bigotry of low expectations. It's to suggest that the poor or disabled cannot make the decision to avoid cruelty *to the extent that is practicable given their situation.*

Of course this only applies to situations where the individual is *legitimately* making an effort to avoid contributing to animal cruelty and exploitation. I have to say that because there's always someone that comes out of the woodwork claiming that I'm suggesting that a wealthy businessman in the US can eat slaughter-based steak and still be vegan.",vegan

Update:

**Wow, I love how many people are engaging with my post and how it has developed into a long list of artisan cheese makers and I've met some cheese-frustrated peers.**

I'm now motivated to take up cheese-making again and I got a couple of other ideas I have to think more about.

I should have emphasized what I mean with good aka great tasting vegan cheese. To me that's cheese with complex aged flavors, strong taste, pungency and funkiness.

Although I'm extremely frustrated with the vegan cheese options atm I'm also very hopeful. When I became vegan, no (as in zero) vegan products (that weren't naturally vegan) existed in my country. Vegan cheese making is still very new and the last decades have really made big leaps towards something decent.

I'm sad to see that some people make condescending comments about being a baby vegan and how long I've been a vegan. What kind of a way is that to judge people. Let's welcome people who are new to veganism.

However, my guess is that I became vegan before most folks on here were born. That does not mean I am entitled to some kind of vegan authority. Fighting speciesism doesn't legitimize ageism - either way.

(They are Omni sadly) I was thinking about how as native people, food is part of our stewardship and harmony with the land. Native peoples used to be able to participate with nature. We received and give gifts back to the land. 

It struck me that there can be NO ethical animal consumption under colonialism. It‚Äôs fundamentally opposed to living with the land. It‚Äôs wrong to raise an animal to die. Meat production at industrial scale is killing the planet. Fish farms poison everything around them. The list goes on.

He just moved out, but BIL (brother in law) doesn't know this. This is also a rule I apply to other guests who come over. People know that if they want to eat animal products then they need to eat it in their cars, but typically that isn't an issue because I love to cook, it's been a long time passion of mine, and I also love opening up my home to host family and friends. I've cooked tons of things for family, including before I went vegan, and their attitudes toward my cooking has always been great, even after making the switch. I make tacos, ""tenderloin"" sandwiches, stir fries, rice & beans, sushi, the works. Whenever people come over they end up helping themselves to seconds and sometimes even thirds, and they are always shocked that vegan food can taste so good. I bring food to thanksgiving, Christmas etc and it gets ate up by everybody. Well, today I open up FB to find my BIL and my Father trashing my food. My Dad posts something about having a great day and BIL comments ""Eating real food in your car? Hahaha"" and they exchange a few other super stupid comments. I responded and essentially told them that it's all good, that they wont have to worry about eating ""fake food"" again because I'm done cooking for them. It was later explained that they didn't think I would see the comments because I haven't actively posted on FB in three years, but I occasionally use it to check in on distant family. When they're at my house, they have no problems going into my fridge to shove their faces with lightlife hotdogs, vegan cheese, and whatever meals I put tons of time into cooking for them. But on the internet behind my back? Apparently they're actually suffering because they didn't eat dead animals for one day, and anything without tortured animal flesh and secretions doesn't count as ""real"" food.

She was not vegan, but after a few months of dating, she went vegan too. I never pushed it on her. I just tried to lead by example and answer any questions she had. She wanted more information and I provided it to her, watched documentaries with her, etc. Ultimately, she went vegan for the animals. The only thing I said about her going vegan was that if she went vegan, and then changed her mind, I would have a hard time looking at her the same.

A few months after she went vegan we moved in together. We were both vegan and never looked back. She would often look down on those who arent vegan and wonder how they could live with the cruelty. She and I lived together for about 2 years before breaking up (she cheated, lied to me about unrelated things and completely broke my trust).

It's been about 2 months since we have stopped living together and I found out she is no longer vegan. This breakup has broken me in so many ways already, but her quitting veganism hit me hard when I found out. It has made me question everything about our relationship and who she really was.

I don't know what to do.,351,1663h35,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1663h35/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,1693464378.0,"I want to cry. I recently got accepted into a veterinary technology program I'd been working very hard toward.  I just need to get this off my chest because no one understands. 

I knew that being in the vet field, I would have to assist in euthanasia (oftentimes very unfair and wrong euthanasia) and see animal suffering. I know that every animal has a human behind them, and those humans can be absolutely awful.  But I never thought that it would be so bad in the vet field itself. 

We have to take an entire class on animal agriculture and have to learn, in detail, about artificial insemination, slaughter, raising animals for slaughter, and dairy farms.  And when I say detail, I mean detail.  We also have to go out to the fair to watch animals give birth (""the animals come from Tyson!!"") My professor said excitedly.  We have to also go to a dairy farm and interact and learn the process of the milk industry.  I should have expected this, and it's very uncomfortable and horrible, but I can suffer through this one class to become certified down the road.

It just blows my mind how hypocritical vets and vet techs are. My one professor said very clearly ""we help animals because of what they do for humans"", ""we don't want to stress these animals out because it hurts the meat or milk"", and ""I love eating meat, I don't want to look at the animal because it makes me sad. But I just love meat."" My other professor was showing an image of a horse with a deformed leg and said he was ""useless"" because he couldn't ""perform any jobs"" and could either be a ""pasture ornament or be euthanized.""

That made me feel so sick. 

We also get animals on campus during the semester so we can learn about the care of them. The pigs and cows that come in are sent off to slaughter after the program is done with them.  The dogs and cats get put back in the kill shelter if they aren't adopted.  The mice and rats are killed on-campus after the semester is done, and the rabbits are sent off to become dog food.

The professor showed no empathy about this.

What's worse, several of the students worked on meat farms. I'm constantly hearing about how they ""LOOOVE meat."" One student said she wanted to have more cows to raise. She talked about her one cow that had a testicular infection and had to have constant medicine.  She had bottle raised this cow, and she said that she would scream at him and call him names when she gave him the medicine cause he was such a pain. And she said ""I can't wait to send him off to be killed before I murder that animal myself.""

The head professor on campus said that no one was allowed to take pictures of the animals there because ""animal rights activists would come after her.""

These are the people that are supposed to be helping animals.  There are no other vegans or even vegetarians here.  I don't know what to do and feel stuck and completely sick to my stomach.

Edit: will all the ppl saying ""oh this isn't true"" or ""there's no way you went into this with zero understanding"" will you just stfu? I went into this program having only worked with small animals and had zero large animal experience.  I knew that slaughterhouses and euthanasia etc etc would be discussed, I'm just appalled at the fact that everyone here LAUGHS at animals dying. I havent heard one person talk about empathy they have for animals.  The SLOGAN on the door to the campus AND on their website says that ""we treat animals because we love them etc etc."" I knew itd be bad, I never thought I'd be surrounded by the worst carnists I'd ever met. This is a vent post because I'm young and I'm struggling, if you don't want to be nice then move along. I'm already having a hard enough time as is without vegans coming at me too.",vegan

Frustrations as a vegan veterinarian,301,160l421,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/160l421/frustrations_as_a_vegan_veterinarian/,1692927260.0,"Thank you for reading what I have to express (and, thanks for being vegan). 

I have been a veterinarian for several years and yet somehow, only recently have I felt this deeply rooted frustration with my profession. Before, the cognitive dissonance around me only scoured my general happiness at work. Then last year, my inner peace was cracked when a coworker who I knew to at least be vegetarian, confessed that they were thinking about eating chicken again. This came after several years of them not doing so. I was really shocked, as I had always assumed that they were one of the rare individuals in my environment who had somewhat aligned their actions with (what I thought was) our common ethical stance.

With a few probing questions, while I tried to keep my emotions at lukewarm, this person admitted that their reasoning for avoiding meat was due to the influence of some sort of ethics-professor mentor in college. So I start there and try to ask standard, epistemologic ethical questions about unnecesssarily eating vs. abstaining from animal products. To start, my fellow veterinarian was not even sure whether we could know if chickens suffered for our food or not. ""Who can really say."" I pushed back but eventually I was too blindsided to continue, back then.

Since then, I have been constantly perturbed by the failure of those around me to recognize that for every individual animal they help they are wantonly condemning countless more to short terrible lives (or long terrible dairy lives), followed by unnecessary death. Over the year, this has struck a cord within me. I have to remind myself often that my colleagues have more or less dedicated their lives and sacrificed plenty to help individual animals and advocate for them. I have hope for them.

My frustration with this double standard around my veterinary hospital has at least emboldened me to openly challenge my colleagues on the ethics of their food choices. I am generally only opening these conversations when they unfold naturally, and it definitely happens more often now that people are aware of my stance. Any time a full discussion is allowed (or tolerated), my fellow animal protectors eventually admit that they agree with veganism, ""but just could not do it because of xyz."" I can only hope that the seeds of doubt I have begun to plant begin to take hold over time. 

I hope to break my fellow veterinarians' illusion of normalcy around eating animal products, as I openly acknowledge the irony of doing so as veterinary caregivers, ""defenders of animals and advocates for those who cannot speak.""",vegan

It's so hard to know for sure whether the things you're paying for - clothes or shoes or paints or glues or toothpastes or cosmetics or even pads and tampons - are not made using animal products.

At least with food, in most countries, companies are required to put ingredients on labels and things.

It's similar with cosmetics, but try understanding a 30+ item list of scientific names, searching them all only to be met with one that _can_ be animal derived, so you know nothing

I've learnt that pretty much all food can be veganised and the only barrier is really accessibility to uncommon ingredients, like banana blossoms or plant proteins. Even in meat dishes, the flavour usually comes from plants, and when it doesn't, there are approximations (soy chunks are rlly good for this). With milk, Alpros Not milk is made with pea proteins and it mimicks dairy down to the after taste (for some people that's a bad thing lol).

‚Äúplants can see you if they‚Äôre standing next to them, so what are vegans going to eat now‚Äù or

Being into classic menswear as a vegan SUCKS,183,169h3v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/169h3v9/being_into_classic_menswear_as_a_vegan_sucks/,1693798967.0,"Just wanted to rant a little, first world problems, yada yada yada.

An underlying reason that it sucks is that they just don't design this type of clothing for vegans. Almost all of the high-quality products that are vegan in this space are incidentally so. There's such little overlap between the vegan/eco-conscious consumer and the classic menswear consumer that high-quality options are ridiculously few and far between, and you can't go to a store and try anything on because they don't sell this type of thing at in-person locations anywhere near you. Added layers of difficulty if you want something made by a company that enforces good labor standards, or if you don't really like wearing synthetics.

\- You want product recommendations? Reddit or menswear forums. Mention you're vegan outside of the r/vegan subreddit and expect countless patronizing comments about how you should buy a leather product because ""leather is more environmentally friendly than vegan leather"" or a wool product because ""shearing a sheep doesn't kill it.""

\- You want a blazer or a suit? Your options off-the-rack are synthetic garbage, secondhand wool (or not, depending on how you feel about it), or linen/cotton. I like the way that a cotton jacket looks, but God forbid you try to find something that looks tailored; structured cotton jackets made with vegan materials are nowhere to be found. They only use cotton for seersucker and unstructured sack suits. Oh, and genuine horn buttons! Great! Would you like a tie with that? Your options are synthetic garbage and cotton, and (from what I can tell) most brands don't make any out of cotton.

\- You want some smart looking derbies? A pair of boots? The technology isn't there yet for high quality vegan leathers. You have to buy something that's made with plastic at least somewhere in the shoes. You have to worry about the kind of message that wearing things that look like leather sends to people. You have to worry about them wearing out quickly. You may not be able to bring them into a cobbler to have them repaired if there are scuff marks or if the sole wears out.

\- You want a nice sweater from a reputable brand? Have fun browsing through pages upon pages upon pages of merino, lambswool, Shetland wool, cashmere, and alpaca.

Giant pain in the ass. You have to do hours of research if you want to find something that's vegan, only to find out from the provided photos that they have a little branded leather patch somewhere on the product for absolutely NO fucking reason. I hate being in love with an aesthetic subculture that is *so* hostile to my ethics and lifestyle.",vegan

Feeling Guilty for being Vegan,173,16289wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/16289wd/feeling_guilty_for_being_vegan/,1693087708.0,"TL;DR: Am I the only one who feels guilty when people have to change plans because I‚Äôm vegan? We had to go to a different restaurant than everyone wanted because they had no vegan options. 

I recently went to an orientation for school in Seattle. A group of 9 of us went to get lunch after. They said there is this pizza joint that they go to all the time, it‚Äôs their routine and it‚Äôs super tasty. I figured I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to get much, maybe I‚Äôd just order something without cheese. 

When we get there, they‚Äôre suggesting getting a pepperoni pizza to share, and I let them know I‚Äôm vegan. (One of the administrator girls was with us, and I told her prior to this that I was vegan, because she told me we would be going to lunch together after the orientation. I guess she forgot?) 
They were totally cool with getting one pizza without cheese for me. When the server comes over, I asked him to verify that it would be vegan with no cheese. He told me no, the pizza crust has bouillon in it? (Meat broth.) So basically, I couldn‚Äôt get anything other than a salad with vinaigrette. I told them I just wouldn‚Äôt order anything, because I wasn‚Äôt very hungry and I just didn‚Äôt really want a salad anyways. 

Everyone is talking about how they felt bad, and I just said no it‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm not hungry, order whatever. I almost always assume if I get food with a big group I won‚Äôt be able to get anything. 

I felt so bad, because they said they really like this place, and everyone is staring at me asking what I wanted to do. I kept reassuring them that it was fine, I didn‚Äôt need to eat. They were trying to think of other places to go, and everyone got all quiet and looked bummed out. I felt so bad, and guilty, because everyone always seems let down by the fact I‚Äôm vegan, and it‚Äôs always a big ordeal. I‚Äôm so tired of places not having any vegan options other than lettuce‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm in SEATTLE?

 I don‚Äôt know why but I literally had to step away and go to the bathroom because I just wanted to cry. I‚Äôm so tired of always being the odd one out. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt fit in with others because we can‚Äôt eat the same food. Everyone decided we should go to this burger place instead, because they had a veggie patty. (Which wasn‚Äôt even good, LOL.) The bun wasn‚Äôt even vegan. I appreciate them trying to make me feel included, but everyone seemed disappointed that we had to go somewhere else. At least the fries were good.",vegan

I was eating my sandwich in a public area, and a guy came up to me and started chatting. We talk for about 5 minutes and the guy seems pretty nice. Eventually, the conversation died down and he got out his lunch and started eating. After around 3 minutes of quiet munching, he offered me some of his food.

I said, ""Thank you, but may I ask what it is?"" He said it was a BLT. I politely declined. He asked me why I said no. I didn't want to say ""because you are a stranger,"" as I felt that would be rude, so I informed him that I am vegan. He did not take that well...

First, he started asking a bunch of loaded questions ""How are your B12 levels? Can you eat honey? Why won't you respect the natural order of things? How can you live without meat?""

I said ""Fine, no, there is no ""natural order of things,"" and I'm clearly alive""

Then, he took one of my food items (without asking) and informed me it wasn't vegan. I said ""no, it very much is,"" and you will never guess what he said... ""But it has sea turtles in it.""

That obviously surprised me so I checked, and it turned out it was part of the sea turtle conservancy.

He then started asking me questions like ""What is in your sandwich, sandwiches aren't vegan.""

He then offered me some of his lunch, again. I asked, ""Is it vegan,"" and he said yes. I took it, looked at the ingredients, and informed him that it contained dairy. He then informed me in a very condescending tone that dairy is vegan. I asked him where he thought dairy came from. He said cows. I said, ""There you go.""

He gave me a long ""ooooohhhhhhhhhhhh,"" and he got extremely defensive. He started pointing out all of the things in his lunch that weren't vegan. ""This has beef, this has eggs, this has dairy.""

At that point, I was extremely angry. I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace. I said ""Oh my god, I really don't care. Eat whatever you want I'm vegan for health reasons (I'm not actually, but this will often get people to stop harassing you).""

Completely ignoring the health benefits of veganism, he went on a long (and very loud) rant on how you need B12 and it can't be found in plants, and how I'm going to die. When I told him that nori, a type of seaweed, as well as water lentils, are plants containing B12 and that VEGANS LIVE LONGER, he stormed off, seething with rage.

This is not the first time that kind of thing has happened to me. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle these kinds of situations in the future?

So, because of my fitness level and height/weight, I should hit a daily protein intake of 100g.

Here's where that gets even tricker on a vegan diet. I'm allergic to the following: gluten (celiac), soy, and maltodextrin (it's in everything processed here in America, from protein powder to Doritos).

Right now, my body is feeling so much better after getting treatment for my medical condition. I'm able to hit the protein intake goals, but by guzzling chicken and eggs.

My friend tried to explain to me that Avocados are not vegan?,101,1632nel,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1632nel/my_friend_tried_to_explain_to_me_that_avocados/,1693171706.0,"The core of the argument is that in order to produce avocados, there has to be pollination with the help of bee's.

I've heard every carnist arguments in the books, but I have to admit that this got me a bit stumped at this argument, for the first time in quite a while. So what are your thoughts and arguments for or against this notion? Are avocado's vegan, sorta bad but still vegan, or even to the point where you would not consider it to be vegan?

(Not related to the post, but I frustratingly asked if they ate honey, to which the answer was yes. Not any special or ''ethical'' brand on the market, just plain old honey found in grocery stores.

Thanks a bunch for your inputs. Some are very educational, some are very funny (calling my friend Piers Morgan lmao). Some points I've taken from the comments are:

> Most crops can be traced to having unethical treatment of insects. So if a vegan couldn't eat avocado's because of the treatment of bees, a bunch of other produce (Broccoli, melon, strawberries, blueberries, apples, cucumber, zucchinis and so on) with be off the table too. 

> Being vegan alone reduces a large amount of unethical practices, so trying to make the case that a vegan needs to be even more restrictive lest they be labeled a hypocrite is a non-argument.

> That said, we should keep an eye out for produce that causes more suffering than needed. I tried to google a bit on my own and found that Palm Oil is supposedly reeking havoc to the degree that even vegans should reconsider consuming it.

2. You are pro life

5. You use hard drugs
6. etc. etc. etc.

So now I am going to do some tongue in cheek gatekeeping. Look, we all know we live in a human centered world. Almost everything is about people and for people. Very little is for any species of animal other than human.

I resent when people try and take veganism away from the animals. I resent when people take whatever human cause they care about, and dictate that you can't be vegan unless you share their same passions.

All of that sort of gatekeeping has the effect of taking veganism away from animals, taking the focus off their pain, their suffering, their deaths. 

So here is my rule. You can't be vegan if you try and make veganism about anything other than what it was intended to be about- saving animals lives.

""Ah, that, you're uh, very interesting.  It's a very interesting issue and the shop is dealing with that very very seriously. There's a whole crew that's working on cutting feathers with laser cutters to see if we can address that.  That being said, there's also other sides of the story, um which are you know, the feathers- the issue is that folks think that because Big Bird is made from feathers for instance, that we are murdering turkeys.""

""Big Bird and Snuffleupagus and Telly.""

Martin P. Robinson responded:
""That's right.  They all involve feathers.  It's one of the kind of hallmarks of Muppet style is that they involve feathers in the fur, in the fur work.  Fact of the matter is, boas and ostriches aren't killed for Telly or Snuffy or Big Bird.""

""Feathers are profitable co-products with the meat industry, they're not byproducts.""

Martin P. Robinson responded:
""Right.""

The activist responded:
""So... It's just been estimated that over 7000 turkeys have been killed since 1969 to decorate the Big Bird puppet so I was just wondering-""

Jimmica Collins (puppeteer) responded:
""Well I do know that we have someone right now who I spoke with who is- she had a really cool technique of making, like you said, the feathers that are cut out of different things so I know that's a thing and we thank you so much for your question.""

The activist responded:
""And I love your show I watched it all the time as a kid-""

Martin P. Robinson spoke over the activist to say:
""And also- no turkey was ever killed to make Big Bird.""

""Well as I said, feathers are profitable co-products with the meat industry, not byproducts, so that's not true.""

So, what do you think? Who is correct here? Is it accurate to say that no birds have ever been killed to decorate these puppets, or that many birds have been killed to decorate these puppets since feathers are not byproducts, but profitable co-products *with* the meat industry?

Despite being much more efficient it'd be fairly pricey because it'd be built with great amenities, for example an elevator, basement parking, a patio roof, and a top floor consisting entirely of shared space where residents could home their small pets and chill.  There'd be a pet ramp from this shared top floor opening onto the patio roof so small dogs/cats could access an outdoor rooftop grass area without needing to be let out.

A place like that doesn't exist but it could!  Nobody builds like that because there's a perception there's no demand at the price point for shared space living and presumably because landlords don't want to double as social workers.  So developers don't take the risk.  But if enough people signaled demand for a shared space development as described then developers might be persuaded.

I've never organized anything like that and doubt I'm the sort to do it but I'd sign up given the chance.  Would you want to live in the proposed development?  If not why not?  Is there a feature it could include that'd change your mind?  I think the vegan community is well positioned to come together to signal demand for such development projects because sharing space more efficiently is better for everybody, animals and humans alike.  It'd also be a great way to gracefully age among other vegans and allow more independent living for people who'd otherwise be unable to live alone.  But it's a hard thing to execute on.  Anyone know how to pull off something like this?

I wonder whether having your own exterior exit would be a big deal?  That'd mean needing raised walkways for every residential floor but the 1st but maybe it'd lend to not feeling a guest in your own home?

We got into a heated 'debate' about the dairy industry, which I had no idea about and he gave me some harsh home truths which I truly didn't believe..turned into a slanging match as I hate losing an argument-he called me an animal abuser (never been called that, in fact the opposite), which shocked me and felt like a stinging slap in the face and I called him a misogynistic prick in response to a reference he made about how I'd feel if my breasts were being treated same way as dairy cows. When I caught a few glimses of the footage I couldn't look away but the short time seeing it was enough to disturb me beyond belief. I walked away abruptly with a horrid, guilty and confusing feeling, like the lie I'd believed all my life was clear to see. I ditched my ice cream in the bin, when he was out of sight and almost threw up at home. I felt repulsed at the dairy items in my fridge and threw them all away. The next day, almost not wanting to believe it, I read (couldn't bear to watch again) articles, literature about dairy and was now thoroughly saddened with accepting it as truth. Anyway am going strong each day at a time,  and educating myself on other types of animal abuse and exploitation, have thrown away and replaced non vegan body products etc. I've seen this guy twice more now as he's there every Saturday and feel like going over to say thanks but feel a bit shy and awkward as he might tell me off or make me feel like I'm eating humble pie. I'm not a creep nor crazy stalker girl but have seen him from a distance and feel like talking to him again. I'm secretly hoping he's single as I've developed a bit of a crush on him. I think it's because he has strong moral beliefs,is obviously caring and the argument triggered something in me. Any thoughts? Please be gentle..

Update: Update: I went up to him and told him about the change I made. He was happy to hear his work made a difference. I asked if he wanted a coffee while on his stand but he said he was going to go to a cafe soon after finishing up for the day and if I wanted to join. I said yes and we had a nice time chatting about activism, general stuff etc. I found out he's only recently single so won't be making any moves or giving him any flirty hints just yet but I did go along with him and some others to the animal rights march in London recently which was nice.

Lab-grown meat could become a problem in our vegan household,58,168a6ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/168a6ny/labgrown_meat_could_become_a_problem_in_our_vegan/,1693679984.0,"I live with my girlfriend and we are both vegan.  She's been down for the cause for 10+ years.  I went vegetarian back in 2014 and committed to veganism when we moved in together in 2020.  This hasn't been hard at all.

We're pretty split on the idea of lab-grown meat, however.  We both think it's a great move for society, but I've asked her about the idea of me buying lab-grown meat products for use at home and that idea really grosses her out (even if ethically she's on board).  It's hard for me to relate to that idea, as someone who has enjoyed meat and cooking meat in the past.  We're both pretty comfortable eating plant foods so I imagine this would be a 'once-in-a-while' thing.

Lab-grown is a very tempting proposition.  I'm making vegan (seitan) brisket this weekend, and I fell down a Texas BBQ rabbit hole.. although I have an ethical objection to eating meat I feel like I would go right back to an omnivorous diet if I could access the lab-grown stuff.  

I really like cooking, and to be honest there are aspects of cooking with meat that I miss, despite the inherent cruelty of the meat-production industry.  Those thoughts aren't strong enough for me to reconsider being vegan and I've been happy denying myself gratification for the greater good.

Has anyone had to deal with this internal cognitive dissonance?  Is there anyone who's on the other side of the argument (lab-grown meat is fine, but not in my house) who can help me understand?  My partner has a revulsion to meat as a 'food object' that I don't share, and I want to be able to appreciate her perspective.

EDIT: We're in Canada so I think Lab-Grown is a few years away here.  Got plenty of time to think about it.",vegan

Going Vegan cold turkey cured my back pain 100%,53,164td93,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/164td93/going_vegan_cold_turkey_cured_my_back_pain_100/,1693340814.0,"I went to the gym for years, stopped during the COVID-19 pandemic, and up until today, I haven't returned to the gym or exercised in general (I'm actually setting up a home gym right now, finally).

In 2022, I developed a terrible pain in my lower back. I couldn't stand for more than a minute (the sad thing is that in 2022 I bought a virtual reality headset and I always played through the pain), and it was horrifyingly even worse when I was sitting! Literally, lying down was the only moment when I didn't have pain (and even then, only in certain positions, which unfortunately weren't my favorites).

When I was out and about with my friends, it was becoming torture, and I was getting used to the pain just to go out. Foolishly, I never went to the hospital for a check-up because I thought, ""It's surely because I'm not exercising, etc., but I'll start working out again soon and everything will get better."" But as I mentioned, for one reason or another, I never went back to the gym.

In January, I became vegan overnight along with a friend of mine (I'm Italian, so I used to eat a lot of good meats and various cheeses); probably without even realizing it, week after week, the inflammation was decreasing. As of today, after 7 months (but actually much earlier), the pains have completely disappeared. COMPLETELY. Literally I'm in my sofa right now in a very unhealthy, slouchy, S position and I feel super fine like I'm ""made of something more elastic and strong"" now.

So, I wonder if there was something that was causing inflammation for me for real? And perhaps during the years when I was working out, it was suppressed or counteracted by the fact that I was at least exercising? It's interesting to see some posts saying the opposite, though, like ""since I became vegan, I've been filled with pains."" Wondering what's their deal.

They can hear in frequencies that make us seem deaf.  Examples go on and on and on - we are so limited by our own sensory experience we fail to recognize all these other forms of intelligence.

My dad had understood that veganism was good for the planet and the animals, but couldn't really give up some of his favorite non-vegan foods, and was a pescatarian at the time. I got him a variety of vegan dairy and fish alternatives and he said he really liked them and agreed to go vegan for a bit. He did say ""a bit,"" but it's a good step.

I think the best way to convince your family members to go vegan (if you are interested in that) is to show them some delicious vegan alternatives because they will often immediately hit you with ""I just could never give up (insert animal product here)"" if you try to start a discussion. What food you like is definitely affected by culture and what you grew up with, so there is a pretty good chance that your favorite vegan products will be theirs as well. Even if they don't want to go vegan, you will at least get some family bonding time out of it, and maybe increase their openness to going vegan in the future.

However, I don't think it's an effective strategy to hit them with ""animal cruelty"" before showing them that vegan food can be good as well. Many have this built-in belief that vegan food is bad ([There is a study to show this](https://www.wri.org/insights/its-all-name-how-boost-sales-plant-based-menu-items)) and if you start with animal cruelty, they will immediately try to think of an excuse or argument that will allow them to continue eating meat. If you instead make them some delicious vegan food, they will see that it's good and will be less likely to argue if you have a calm discussion about animal cruelty. Don't call them animal abusers though. It just doesn't work. It will just make them mad.

&#x200B;

Edit: I want to clarify that I'm not saying that you shouldn't talk about animal cruelty. I am suggesting that if someone seems to hold the view that all vegan food is disgusting or ""I can't live without \_\_\_\_"" it is useful to show them some tasty vegan food that way when the topic of animal cruelty comes up they don't just dismiss and ignore you with ""But bacon though.""",vegan

My boyfriend would like me to be flexible to experience foods with him especially when traveling where vegan is limited,36,1684x8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1684x8o/my_boyfriend_would_like_me_to_be_flexible_to/,1693667357.0,"     Initially, when we started dating, I was conflicted on the idea of being a flexitarian. I stood my ground and said no matter what, I wanted to be vegan all my life and hope to have stronger morals and ethics as I grew older. He backed off and agreed to eat vegan when we went out.

     When he went to korean BBQ and a French bakery with his family he got sad thinking about our future because when he experienced how he enjoyed sharing foods with his family at those locations he thought it would've been amazing to share that experience with me. I had mentioned we can share that experience together when we explore vegan restaurants and foods together, or if you eat non vegan at a restaurant and I eat vegan, we are sharing the moment together.. he said it's not the same because we're not experiencing the foods together and what about when we travel and experience cultural foods.

     For a while, he would be okay with me eating vegan, and he would join me eating some vegan and have some non vegan food on another dish, and I was okay about it. I told him I didn't want to limit him on foods, so it's okay that he eats nonvegan in front of me. He also doesn't like to be limited, and he's strong on that stance because he grew up in an environment for 8 months only having rice and soysauce.. I reason with him. 

     Months later, he mentions his concerns, and he is still worried thinking about the future of us and about me. I can get sensitive when he makes jokes about veganism. I said, ""I'll try not to get offended"", and I think I've gotten better to be more relaxed, but it still bothers me a bit when he sends me instagram posts with meat in it. 

     So now we are here.. we discussed about the food issues and I said when I grow up and we have kids I will make sure my kids will be fed whether vegan or not and I will cook and feed him dishes whether vegan or not. I don't want this conflict to ruin our future. I feel like I'm already bending my back for him to appease him. 

     He made an ultimatum last night. He said, ""You can't tell me im your world (which I do say and I mean it) and can't devote yourself to me."" (He's also sort of religious to God, so he uses words like that occasionally, and beliefs are also something we discuss since I am currently aethiest) I said, ""What do you mean devote?"" He said, 'You can't tell me im your world if you devote yourself to veganism."" I said, ""You can't devote yourself to me if you devote yourself to God"". it's a two-way street. 

     He wants to be with someone who can share foods with him vegan or not. I said, ""I say you're my world because I mean it, and me being vegan doesn't have anything to do with how I feel about you."" So his meaning on ""you're my world"" is defined differently between us, and I had to clarify that to him. 

     He brought up this story I told before about a YouTuber I used to watch all the time growing up because she shared lazy vegan dishes to make then one day, after she was hiatus for a bit, posted a video why she is not vegan anymore because she realized that living in a cultural family eating together is more important for her and she didn't want to feel restricted and conflicted about eating with her family. My bf liked that story because he agreed with that idea and told me that he wanted someone like that.

     I would like to know how you guys feel about it and if you have experienced something like this before and what you did? I feel a bit exhausted trying to convince him and appease to him that I love him and these are small worries to be concerned about. 

     He's always mentioned he wish I wasn't on birth control because he worries about how it's probably messing up my hormones and how emotional I get and how that's probably why I'm on mood regulated medications so with that I agreed since I'm on my last month of my birth control implant I will have it removed soon. Although I was initially on birth control because I am worried about having kids and being on medication, it isn't as bad as being broke with kids.. but I digress. 

     Again, what have yall experienced in relation to what I've mentioned? Help..",vegan

I definitely think this community enhances my Dharma understanding and practice. However, I'm struggling to get past the fact that the teacher isn't vegan, when that is a huge moral thing for me, personally, and is informed by my understanding of harm reduction to sentient beings and the Dharma. On one hand, this feels like an attachment, which we're encouraged to let dissipate. However, I also wonder if it makes any sense to seek a spiritual student-teacher relationship when we disagree on this as a moral issue, Buddhist or not. I still very much respect him and don't think of him as a lesser Buddhist or lesser person because of his non-vegan diet, but I wonder if it would be foolish to ask him to be my teacher in this case. I guess some important context is that I've tried out all the other traditions and sanghas in the area (there aren't many) and none of their teachers/leaders are vegan either.",vegan

First: going back to eating animals is out of the question. It is obvious that the life of an animal raised for slaughter and for the production of eggs and milk is unquestionably without comparison to ""eating bad food"". That is not what is at issue here. So I would like advice from people who identify or have had an experience similar to mine. I don't have any vegan acquaintances with whom I can share my journey to veganism. I'm a little sad and I don't want to be cursed by those who think what I'm going to say is futile.  

Eating has always been one of my favorite things, but ever since I decided to stop eating meat after the blindfold came off, I have absolutely no pleasure in eating. It's not even that I miss meat, but since I started transitioning (a year ago) there just hasn't been a single time where I've had the feeling: what wonderful food!!!! ü§§  

I'm Brazilian and here in my country there's a very strong barbecue culture on the weekend, snack bars and stands selling skewers, pastries and hot dogs everywhere. In the region where I live, there are already some vegan food options, but it is more restricted to noble areas and expensive restaurants. Food is more expensive than ""normal"". I've only eaten from these places four times. One was a delicious hamburger, and the rest I didn't like at all. Including another terrible burger and a tasteless pizza.  

Along with my first piece of pizza came massive disappointment.  

Anyway. I eat every day my food that I make at home only. In the first two months, I even did nice things, maybe because of the initial excitement, but after that, nothing.  

Lunch and dinner, which were the highlight of my day, have now become just moments to feed myself because I need to nourish myself.  
All that's left is the frustration of tasteless food.  
When I want something tastier, I end up sticking to French fries or processed snacks with soda. And I eat a lot of snacks, I don't want this habit because it's not good for health.  
I hate this shitty system that was built on top of animal exploitation. Yesterday I arrived tired from work and I just wanted to buy two damn huge pastries to eat and rest.  

But currently, I feel the extreme futility of taking an entire life from an animal, to eat a snack in 15 minutes. It does not give. I don't necessarily miss the taste of meat. I already get nauseous from some smells, I accidentally ate beans with pork and was disgusted. But I also don't like the things I eat these days.  

I see vegans talking about how they discovered different flavors after transitioning, but it hasn't been like that with me. This makes me very frustrated, because I think: if so many can do it easily, why has it been so difficult for me?  
Anyway, has anyone gone through something similar? What could they cook to improve?  
Some of the dishes I made turned out to be terrible, so I've actually been making the same things every day, which are the ones that worked. But it's not like I find it delicious either. And I'm already sick of eating the same thing so much.  

Things like tofu I never ate, because in my city it's too expensive. And right now I don't want to make it at home, because it's time consuming, and I already spend a lot of time cooking my meals for the week.  

Tldr: I no longer take pleasure in food and would like advice from anyone who has gone through the same thing. Life is already too hard not to have moments of joy from food.",vegan

I am a 31yo working in financial services and considering going back to school. I am from Europe (Italy) but currently living in the US. 

My dream is working for a company that promotes anti animal abuse practices - ultimately creating my own company of plant-based alternatives - but it seems very ambitious and hard to reach rn with my background.

I am considering studying a Master's in Renewable Energy in Spain and end up working for a green energy developer: good for the environment but not much for the animals.

In your opinion what's the most vegan-friendly career path (please avoid suggesting working at animal sanctuaries, I currently volunteer at one but need real source of income)?

I was thinking of an Executive MBA (in Europe, since it's cheaper than in the US) that can give me a better way to ultimately create my own company but tuition fees are mad.

I am a little lost and would love some help.

If I know anything about psychology, I think human beings respond better to the former (which is ridiculous cause we should be focusing on the veracity of the information). 
            
           I get humans aren't always logical and people have a tendency to focus on how someone made them feel rather than what they said. I get it, sometimes it's the messenger not the message itself. That being said, I have my doubts as to whether or not ed winter's method of activism is the most effective. Don't get me wrong I love the way ed does activism and I watch alot of his videos to learn how to communicate with non vegans. But I realized that most of the people who get overly emotional and get butthurt that a vegan made them feel bad, were never going to go vegan in the first place. Me being overly dogmatic, preachy, militant (insert your vegan stereotype here) to that person was never really going to change that. 
          
          I feel that most people who go vegan don't focus on whether or not militant vegans made them feel bad. We just listen to the arguments and see if they have any logical consistency. Most people who go vegan aren't focused on whether or not another vegan was a militant asshole to them. We as vegans don't focus on the person's assholery, but more on whether or not the reasons to go vegan are sound and make sense.

I already opened one carton to use it, and it already tastes bit weird, looks like it's really gonna go bad in a day or two.

Do animals suffer more in abusive shelters compared to on the street?,11,162ytw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/162ytw6/do_animals_suffer_more_in_abusive_shelters/,1693162898.0,"In LA, conditions in City animal shelters are so bad that it's routine for dogs to go days, weeks, or even months without being walked. The live in overcrowded conditions (2 or 3 dogs squeezed into a kennel meant for 1) and endure dirty kennels, weather exposure, and missed meals. What they experience is downright abuse. LA has a No-kill policy but the shelters don't have have the infrastructure to actually make life anything less than hellish for the animals that end up essentially imprisoned for life.[https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-14/la-city-animal-shelters-dogs-sit-in-kennels-weeks-months-without-walks](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-14/la-city-animal-shelters-dogs-sit-in-kennels-weeks-months-without-walks)

There appears to be no possibility that the City will meaningfully fix the problems with how the shelters are run, at least not anytime in the next few years or decade even.

All the suffering in the shelters makes me wonder what the hell is their point if they make life so horrendous for animals? Would a stray or abandoned animals life actually be better if we allowed them to live on the street, relatively? If I were to find a stray animal that I couldn't take care of (and if I couldn't find a good rescue org to take them in) would it be better for me to leave it be, rather than call Animal Control? Or are shelters still more humane when compared to living on the streets?

The way I see it, life in these shelters are similar to life in solitary confinement. The one positive I see is that  animals in shelters do have access to a pathway to adoption. But then again street animals could also potentially be adopted, plus I would think they have a good chance of being less traumatized by the streets than the shelters, and therefore more adoptable.

Are shelters like these simply pet prisons? Or are they still the better evil?

We have a 1 year old who has been raised eating a plant based diet and we would like that to continue going into his pre-school. So far the pre-school has been very positive to our emails, but, there was some language from our ""council/state department"" (we live in sweden so Im not sure the best word) maybe ""municipality"" is correct, that said that they dont recommend a Plant Based diet.

They justified this by saying our health authority here in sweden doesnt recommend this type of diet, but the health authority actually does say that it is ok as long as we are in contact with health professionals and a dietician. For months I have been asking our healthcare givers for blood tests because I knew we were going to have to have this fight. We have nothing to hide and infact I would love there to be real data and evidence to show the positives and negatives of a plant based diet. They stated that they dont do blood tests for this reason. If we were worried about his health they would do a blood test though.. which to me is completely backwards, but here we are.

We are in the middle of setting up a meeting about how our healthcare provider is misinterpreting or misrepresenting the health authorities advice (from a position of personal bias is my opinion) but I would really like some help if anyone else has been in a similar position?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance

&#x200B;

**Update for interested readers**

Talked to a dietician this morning and they agreed that the school is misinterpreting the authorities advice. We have started a food tracking journal with them and we will monitor food intake and nutrician levels. This is a guesstimate as the dietician isnt able to run blood tests.

The healthcare center called us to apologise also as they had taken another look at the authorities recommendations but they still will not give us a certificate of health as we are eating this way for ethical reasons and not medical ones. We feel we have done all we have been asked for by the school, so we will see what happens next week at school start.",vegan

What is the response for the arugument super cold countries year around need to eat meat because they cant grow fruits and vegetables if the temperatures can not allow it to happen.

I agree they could go to the grocery store since the world is getting more resources shipped around and locally they can have greenhosues for fruits and vegetables to be grown for the community.

Before this, when we didnt have much technology they needed to eat meat is the argument. They also use hide from animal skins to keep warm as it is absolutely freezing.

The Paradox of Intolerance and the Liberation Pledge,10,15xtm66,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/15xtm66/the_paradox_of_intolerance_and_the_liberation/,1692675173.0,"The Paradox of Intolerance is a very old idea in philosophy that can be roughly simplified to this:  If we tolerate the intolerant, the intolerant will shape society in such a way as to exclude tolerance entirely and we will have done the opposite of what we intend.  Therefore, if our goal is tolerance we have to be intolerant of intolerance.

The Liberation Pledge, in its original unsullied format, has three tenets:
1. Be vegan.
2. Don't sit at a table where animals are being eaten.
3. Encourage others to take this pledge.

There seems to be a contrary idea among some in the vegan community that we should happily sit at tables where our friends have committed terrifying acts of animal cruelty and pretend that it's okay so that we don't upset them and risk shutting down a line of communication with them.  **I really, really disagree with this but I'd like to hear some more thoughts about it because I acknowledge the possibility that I'm wrong.**

My argument is that every time I allow animal abuse to happen in my presence and don't fight it I become slightly complicit in that abuse.  I acknowledge that this feels like a heavy burden and there will be times where we feel too weak or frightened to act even though we know we should.  Silence benefits the status quo, right?  We acknowledge this when it comes to racism and sexism and I don't think there's a lot of question that if our friend says something racist we'd be in the wrong if we didn't speak out against that racism.  If they asked us out to an event where they were going to kill some people they hate, wouldn't it be even worse for us to go silently along and just...watch?  Not speaking out against it, not trying to save the victim, not trying to stop the killer, not doing anything at all?

I think we have an obligation to fight for those less powerful than ourselves.  I think sitting at a table with carnists and pretending that nothing terrible is happening is a betrayal of that obligation.  I think that it empowers carnists to keep killing because from their point of view the vegan isn't upset about them eating flesh so it must be okay.  I think that's just us tolerating intolerance.

If the goal of coddling carnists is to keep them open to ongoing conversations, what point is there if you're not having those conversations?  Meals are the perfect opportunity to advocate and they come up _all the time_.  Is there a reason I should allow animal abuse to happen unchallenged in my presence?  Does that somehow reduce animal abuse?  Is there something to the argument for tolerating intolerance or is it just a rationalization to cover up our fear?",vegan

I tried not to think much of it, because well it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm ever buying from these companies (my car is 100% vegan. I know a lot of vegans who for some reason drive non-vegan cars even though all of their clothes, etc are vegan. I think there‚Äôs a tendency for oversight when it comes to cars). 

Back to my point, there‚Äôs a voice in the back of my head says it is worse. Because even though I‚Äôm not buying from these companies, I‚Äôm purchasing some level of ownership of the companies (no matter how small) and that means I profit off of these companies‚Äô decisions some of which involve harm towards animals and the environment.

I need the money & currently smart stock investment seems like the only way to reach my financial goal in the short term, but is it really worth compromising my values and morals?

Lately a few of those same family members have been trying to lose weight and switched to a keto diet. They‚Äôre clearly taking it very seriously for health reasons. Watching the documentary ‚ÄúThe Game Changers‚Äù on Netflix has got me thinking that bringing up the health affects of switching in gentle ways here and there might be the hook to get some people interested in veganism, and once they‚Äôve taken a few steps in, they‚Äôd probably be more open to hearing about the ethical side of it as well.

Seeing them sit quietly in their small cages, subjected to the noise and jostling. A literal house of horror awaiting them. To say nothing of what they've already been through in their very short lives. 

About a month ago I saw a comment on a Dodo video about chickens on Facebook, I think it was the most upvoted comment. A lady was how lovely the chicks in the video were, and how she grew up on a chicken farm. And she was very proud of her mother for being the first Purina-certified female chicken farmer. And as a kid, it was so amazing to every six weeks have so many batches of chicks, each one so precious. ""But you have to understand, this a business."" I hate that justification so much. Slave trading was (is) a business. If others have to suffer because of your business, *shut down your business.* 

Several people (including my first therapist) have said I have too much empathy, and yes I am very sensitive. But how can the majority of people care so little for the pain of these animals? I was eight when I wanted to stop eating meat. I didn't need to see footage of a slaughterhouse or have a connection to a cow or pig, I just understood that they would have to die for me to eat them, and I didn't want them to die. And yet most people, even seeing the footage (or working in a slaughterhouse) won't go vegan. I know working in a slaughterhouse has high turnover rates and is a great way to get PTSD, but it's still not enough to get people to stop paying others to help these innocent creatures.

I know the best thing to do is just to harden my heart and not think about their plight so much (while still trying to do my best to promote veganism). It's just so demoralizing, how much all those innocent animals must suffer because people are terrible. Granted, most people are unconcerned about their diets helping to hasten ecological collapse (which *will* affect them) because ""it's all the fault of corporations, not individual consumers"". sigh just really hate people sometimes :( sorry I just needed to rant",vegan

Dating carnivores, being friends with carnivores, working with carnivores ... it's starting to legitimately hurt my mental health.  I feel that I've wasted alot of time in life around bad situations (childhood trauma, bad relationships, terrible jobs, etc), and am now fully focused on creating the best life possible.  I'm lucky in that I got my mom and my sister to go vegan a decade ago, but my mom recently passed away, and my sister & I are not in touch for completely unrelated reasons (& we will not be back in touch, ever).  So, I've lost my vegan team, and I just feel really alone and like I have no community/no family.  I will ALWAYS be vegan, but i really want to incorporate my values (veganism, sobriety, being active, making art, practicing gratitude, etc) into my social life more, and the less I have that safe-haven of a vegan family, the LESS tolerant I am of being around ignorant/sociopathic people who eat animal products and buy pets, etc.   I have some great friends where I live, in Atlanta, but we are not really growing in the same direction ... at all.   They aren't really growing, to be honest. 

The other issue, is that these feelings have created a ripple effect ... maybe it's my age, but I am starting to almost become nauseous when I'm around friends/strangers who discuss frivolous things, like celebrity gossip, or talk about partying/conspiracy theories, or are drinking/high 24/7, like I just CAN'T be around low-brow conversations, or people who are eating meat/binge-drinking, etc.   I don't wanna watch people self-harm, or vent unhealthily. 

I need to find a tribe with a high vibe.  I know veganism is the answer, in some way.  My problem is that alot of vegans I've met (online or when I lived in LA) didn't seem to have much else going on in their lives, and they become fanatical about veganism, like they're in a cult ... I also love films, hiking, dancing, swimming, being social, animal rescue, etc, and most of the vegans I knew were antisocial, angry hermits (or aren't vegan anymore). 

I've gone to vegan meet-ups in Atlanta, years ago, but it was very click-y, everyone was decades older than me, and the meet-ups were all based around bingeing at potlucks (I don't enjoy potlucks or gluttony, which is honestly what it felt like).

I feel like veganism should be normal, and it **has** been normal in my life for so long ... and therefore, I don't need to talk about it (or food) 24/7.  I just want normal, healthy vegan friends, and a normal, healthy, awesome vegan husband, lol.    Any advice would be soooo very appreciated. ",vegan

on the one hand, it makes me uncomfortable to agree to buy dairy because it‚Äôs such a cruel industry. even the ‚Äúhumane‚Äù brands are inevitably exploiting and traumatizing their animals. in my opinion the concept of ‚Äúhumane‚Äù animal agriculture is comparable to that of ‚Äúhumane slavery‚Äù‚Äî the quality of life is better, and that‚Äôs not insignificant, but it‚Äôs wrong regardless. i don‚Äôt want to support that, even indirectly. 
on the other, though, veganism isn‚Äôt about my feelings, or not compromising my morals. it‚Äôs about the animals, and the actual difference we can make for them. and honestly, the way to get more people to consider plant based options isn‚Äôt to try to force veganism on them. people should feel positive about incorporating more plant based foods into their life, and acting like the ‚Äústereotypical vegan‚Äù only makes them associate veganism with negativity. it will have more of an impact on ending animal agriculture if a larger amount of people eat vegan alternatives part of the time, than if a niche group only eats vegan foods, and everyone else is alienated from them.

I believe the Southern California vegan restaurant ecosystem (one of the most sizable in America) evolved more from an emphasis on human health rather than compassion for other species.

Someone posted similar the other day in terms of hard numbers- ie if 2% of carnists reduced their meat consumption by 50% it would save more animals than converting 1%. 

In general, impactful people/companies have positive, optimistic and non-condescending messages. Extending human life and bettering human health are positive messages. 

Until we successfully lobby to make animal slaughter illegal, pro-animal messages are perceived as ‚Äúangry‚Äù and condescending because the act of slaughtering and eating meat has been normalized and celebrated. 

To summarize, I feel that the two most important activities we (Americans) can focus on are:

1) Continuing to lobby for animal welfare laws, changing the terms of the $80 billion US Farm Bill, eliminating subsidies for animal slaughterers, etc

In the last year I have met a ""big predator"" hunter who works for the government killing large animals because if he didnt it would be dangerous to society and who had worked on a project in an african country that made sport hunting legal because otherwise ""poachers would desimate the population"". 

Then recently I had a discussion with a family friend who claimed that wild boar were introduced to this country 400 years ago, so hunting them is actually returning nature to its proper balance.

In both situations I was incredibly mad but solidered through with polite conversation to keep the peace. 

In the first instance I mostly listened and asked questions because, to be  fair, I know little of this african nations politics and his argument was because people were paying to kill the animals the government invested in natual parks etc... its a reach but  maybe I just think better of people. I dont know.

The second I spoke up and literally walked this old man through the mental process. I listened to him, and then started to talk about while it is true these particular wild boars are introduced, there was a wild boar population here for  10's of thousands of years before hand. Which sort of lands a little awkward on this guys ears as he's a bit of a bible believer and I wouldnt put it past him if he really thought the earth was 4 000 years old. But he used to work for the city in the parks department and knows a little bit about old ""viking"" drawings in his home city and there is depictions of wild boar in those, and those are at least 1 000 years old. I could literally see the cogs starting to move as the reality of his facebook echo chamber started imploding.

I felt really happy with the second interaction but still feel miserable about the first. As at the first interaction the Hunters 13 year old daughter was at the table.

I prefer a pretty strict separation of sweet and savory foods, but I was thinking about carrot cake (which I love), and wondering whether I could make ice cream that had that goodness and not the unpleasantness of carrot juice (which I heartily dislike). I wanted something to go with the carrot, and came up with basil. It's not the most obvious choice, but I do really like.

I used the Cuisinart vanilla recipe (soy milk, soy cream, sugar, vanilla), and blended a small chunk of carrot and a handful of basil leaves with some of the milk. It generated a not-too-enticing light, murky green. I used that to make ice cream as usual, and at the end added a bunch of torn basil leaves and a handful of grated carrots.

The Humane League is currently campaining against BJ‚Äôs Restaurant and Brewhouse for using extremely cruel wire battery cages to house chickens. These innocent animals spend their entire lives locked in cages that are so small they are unable to move or spread their wings. In 2016, BJ‚Äôs publicly promised that they would transition to 100% cage-free by 2025, but they have been silent ever since. There is no evidence of any progress being made to end the suffering of these animals.

So, we will be holding a peaceful protest on the sidewalk outside of BJ‚Äôs Restaurant & Brewhouse in Charlottesville, VA this Saturday, August 26th, from 12 pm - 1:30 pm! We would truly appreciate the support of all the animal lovers near the area! All are welcome to join to put an end to this cruelty!

If you would like to attend, please sign up using the link in this post! Thank you!!",vegan

The only vegan yogurt I can find near me (siggis) stopped being sold so I was getting normal, and a few times I added cheese to meals just for the high calorie content but its grossing me out and makes me feel guilty, I dont want to continue to eat dairy.

The first time I was served ""impossible meat"" I was a teenager; I thought ""Jesus Christ its like I'm eating a cow!! Ew!!!"" and could not eat more than one bite without gagging.

I understand how these brands of ""simulated"" meat are probably crucial for getting meat eaters to be interested in vegan diets. But at the same time its disgusting that they simulate the taste and texture of dead flesh to me! And to have those simulated meats basically take over the meatless options in restaurants!!

Hospital can't provide vegan food,1886,z8v9pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/z8v9pq/hospital_cant_provide_vegan_food/,1669824317.0,"So my husband checked himself in to the Veterans Affairs hospital almost two weeks ago for help with his mental health. 


They're not able to adequately provide vegan food and aren't allowing visitors or outside food due to strict covid restrictions. On his 4th day there, he broke down because he was again served something with cheese when the nurses said it was vegan. We're ethical vegans and my husband has never broken his veganism since deciding to fully commit about 6 years ago. 



The doctor thinks he is overreacting about not being flexible with food given. They have literally only served him steamed vegetables, plain salads, and peanut butter sandwiches since his break down over the food since those are the only vegan items avaliable. His mental health is getting even worse because he isn't being cared for nutritionally and the nurses and doctor just can't comprehend why breaking away from being vegan would be even more detrimental to his mental health.


He's been getting worse as the days have gone on, and a lot of it has to do with not being able to eat food. I'm just so fed up. I finally told him yesterdsy he just needs to ask to be discharged against medical advice and we will go to a private clinic, which we have done before and they were able to provide vegan meals, no problem.


I'm just disgusted with the lack of care we're receiving due to an ethical choice. A religious person who doesn't eat pork would never have been pressured to just give in and eat pork because the hospital couldn't figure out another option.



Edit: Thank you to everyone for the support. This post blew up way more than I expected and I really appreciate all the concern and empathy this community has shown. My husband came home today and we will be doing a different clinic going forward. I know there are a lot of comments for and against the VA. I will say that he said the doctor seemed to genuinely want him to get better, but there was a lot of disconnect in understanding veganism and why the food options affected his mental state. We're in a conservative southern state, and I know that shouldn't be an excuse, but it feels like veganism is so foreign to so many people here. He said he worked with two dieticians while there and that they both questioned what he was able to eat at home. He said one dietician, in particular,  did seem like she was really trying which is why eventually they were able to get veggie patties for him.



The doctor did highly recommend my husband leave feedback as to what the VA can do better, so someone will be in touch with us soon so we can share our experience.


I know there are some comments about covid restrictions, and honestly, it surprised us too that covid restrictions were still being heavily enforced. He said the patients were not even allowed out of their rooms without a mask or allowed to eat in a common area.",vegan

Basically, we read a play in between class then discuss it the whole class, often going off topic. Any good discussion is encouraged. Super liberal class. 95% of discussion all semester has been about capitalism criticism, feminism, and racism.

Anyway, this is the last group discussion of the semester. We all need to go in a circle and talk about a topic the play made us think of. Last class. Might as well bring up veganism. Never done it before. Can't hurt, right?

WRONG.

The person before me talks about racism and systematic inequality and how it connected to the play. She's done. It's my moment. I slowly ease into how I think the inequality between livestock and pets is gross. I'm nervous, being very polite and trying not to come off as judgy. Everyone here is mega liberal, so this is fine, yeah?

The person before me says, ""You remind me of the tik tok *I can excuse racism, but I draw the line at animal cruelty.*""

Oh no.

The only black person in the room just accused me of being racist.

All 13 people turn angrily at me. I didn't even mention race?? I guess because I steered the conversation from race to animal welfare, she thought I didn't care about racism? Or was saying animal welfare is more important?? Idk. All I know is the next few minutes were not. Good.

""What about people who need to hunt to survive? Do you hate native tribes?""

""Not everyone is privileged enough to afford veganism.""

""Have you seen farmers plowing land? It's a Holocaust for insects! Why care about cows but not insects? You just care more about them because they're cute. YOU'RE discriminating.""

""Why demonize consumers when corporations are to blame? Us not eating meat won't change anything.""

All talking at the same time, battering me with another angry question before I can even answer. I was overwhelmed. I didn't get to say much before

""Let's get back to the important topic at hand: racism.""

Apparently I pissed them off because racism is a serious issue and animal suffering isn't, and even mentioning it was terrible because I was acting like these things were on the same level.

So yeah. They talked about race for maybe a minute before moving onto Tumblr, joking, laughing. My professor asked if Tumblr was a dating app, and everyone broke down laughing.

I stared at my laptop, dead eyed, empty the next 45 min of class while everyone joked and had a grand time.

While leaving, someone told me, ""It's cute you care so much about animals! :)"" Others glared at me for being a racist piece of shit (I never mentioned race???)

I have terrible anxiety. I cried after everyone left. Can't wait to give a presentation in front of them all tomorrow.

"Take your freaking B12 supplements, people",1790,yoh1q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/yoh1q0/take_your_freaking_b12_supplements_people/,1667810598.0,"Edit 3. I don't know if it's my wording, an issue of semantics, some language barrier or what exactly but I think the point of my post has been lost. B12 is an essential nutrient. It is not found naturally in plant sources. If you eat vegan you need to supplement it one way or another, either via pills, tablets, or shoots, regularly eating fortified foods everyday, via injections... But you need to do it. If there's no source of B12 in your intake, you WILL run into a deficiency sooner or later. And B12 deficiencies are no laughing matter.

Anecdotal evidence is not science, so here's a series of resources written by MDs and nutritionists where you can learn more about B12 on a vegan diet:

* [Vitamin B12](https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/), Jack Norris RD
* [Vitamin B12: A Vegan Nutrition Primer](https://www.theveganrd.com/vegan-nutrition-101/vegan-nutrition-primers/vitamin-b12-a-vegan-nutrition-primer/), Ginny Kish Messina, MPH, RD
* [Vitamin B12](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-b12/), Michael Greger, MD
* [Adequate Vitamin B12 on a Plant Based Diet](https://www.pickuplimes.com/article/adequate-vitamin-b12-15), Sadia Badiei, Nutritionist and Dietitian

Also relevant: [Vitamin B12 Recommendations: Updated](https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12-recommendations-updated/) and [What Every Vegan Should Know About B12. An Open Letter From Health Professionals and Vegan Organizations](https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/what-every-vegan-should-know-about-vitamin-b12/).

I can't quote stuff directly right now because Reddit is messing my formatting. But the takeaway from reading through those is that you NEED a reliable source of B12, supplements being typically recommended to avoid risk. Also because they are cheap, convenient, effective, and reliable.

Needless to say, do refer to your local nutritionist for questions about your diet. It's also a good idea to get your blood work done every few months or once a year to make sure everything is in order, even if you do supplement.

Whether it's an adequate quantity of fortified foods of your choice daily or a supplement: TAKE IT. Do not play with your health because it's extremely easy and cheap to avoid risking it.

\----Original post below----

No ifs or buts. Take it.

""I've been vegan for 3 years with no supplements and I'm fine"" and you WILL develop a B12 deficiency if you keep that up.

Nooch and fortified plant milks are not consistent enough of a source.

You can get almost 2 years worth of B12 supplementation for like 20 bucks.

It's extremely easy, cheap, and convenient to supplement it and you will avoid the hell that is B12 deficiencies. Don't play with this.

Take. The. Supplement.

Edit:

Speaking of: Buy the plant based milk that's fortified with calcium, use iodized salt when cooking, and remember to include a source of omega3 in your daily diet (either using canola/grapeseed oil, walnuts, chia seeds, flax seeds, hemp seeds, etc). Just because you are vegan doesn't mean you are immune to deficiencies.

Edit 2: You CAN get enough B12 from fortified foods (which is another form of supplementation), but how reliable that is for most people is questionable. You need to be eating typically several servings of specific products to keep it up consistently.",vegan

Going vegan has taught me that most people don't care about anything that doesn't affect them.,1646,10vja0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/10vja0g/going_vegan_has_taught_me_that_most_people_dont/,1675720167.0,"After the seemingly-obligatory jokes and ""I love burgers tho"" comments, the most common response people give to my animal rights arguments is something along the lines of, ""I understand why people are vegan, and like, factory farming is really disturbing, but personally, I couldn't be vegan."" I ask why, and if they know what factory farming really is, why wouldn't they be vegan? Why don't they feel a moral obligation? And the response is that they just don't care enough, or they would rather eat meat. I've had people respond ""It's really great that you're vegan, and vegans are doing a good thing, but frankly I just don't care enough to be vegan"" 

My faith in humanity was low previously, but now it's even further in the gutter. Sometimes I find myself falling into a depressive episode thinking about how no one seems to give a shit about animals and this is really the world I'm in and nothing I can say or footage I can show them will change their minds. My friend said he bet I had a documentary I could show him that would convince him to be vegan, but he wouldn't want to watch it because he wants to eat meat. 

How do people's minds work like this? How can they sleep at night? Why is me being vegan the butt of every joke? I hate myself for uncomfortable laughing when people make jokes diminishing animal rights. But I don't have any vegan friends. Sometimes I have moments where I'm sitting with someone, maybe at dinner, and they're eating animal flesh, and I feel like throwing up, and they just treat it as a quirk, because they just \*don't care\*. 

I've never had a particularly optimistic view of human nature. I mean just look at our history. But I guess I'm just really upset this is the world we live in.",vegan

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies! I see a lot of people responding it might be because of the vivisection, but I study in Italy and here we don't do vivisection, just dissection, which I know is still cruel, but still they are very different things.

A year ago I was a meat eater. But after having pets for the first time in my life, I could no longer convince myself that it was ok to eat animals. So I joined the vegetarian subs planning to go that route. Almost immediately I saw comments in the vegetarian subs from vegans about the egg & dairy industries. I honestly assumed a lot of it was fake or exaggerated, but I looked into it and quickly realized that everything they said was true. The part about what happens to male chicks in the egg industry was especially radicalizing for me. So, I went vegan last summer. And it was 100% a direct result of some ‚Äúannoying vegans‚Äù posting in the vegetarian subs. I never replied to their comments, I just joined some vegan subs and never looked back.   

I know those methods are kind of controversial, but I just wanted to say that, at least one time, they did work.

I appreciate this, but when I get there this morning I see 3 big bags of animal body parts marinating in the fridge. 

I asked my mom if that was for tonight, and she said yes. They‚Äôre having a barbecue, but don‚Äôt worry because they‚Äôre ordering me vegan food. 

I‚Äôve been vegan for 7 years and recently I‚Äôve been pretty quiet about it because I‚Äôve given up and they get mad at me any time I even express why I‚Äôm vegan because they think I‚Äôm ‚Äúattacking heir personal choice,‚Äù etc. But we used to have big discussions about this and they all know it upsets me any time I see them celebrating something by killing animals. So when I confronted my mom this morning and said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs my birthday,‚Äù she says ‚Äúwell you‚Äôre not the only person in the world! This one‚Äôs coming and that one‚Äôs bringing her boyfriend, and they LIKE protein!‚Äù

I thought I could have one day a year where I could see my family without being upset about this, but it‚Äôs apparently too much to ask my family to go one meal a year without meat to make me happy. 

She says, ‚Äúoh I didn‚Äôt know you felt so strongly.‚Äù Like why do you think I‚Äôm vegan??? That proves she never listened because every time I tried to answer why I was vegan she would cut me off and say ‚ÄúI know! I understand everything so stop explaining. I just don‚Äôt agree.‚Äù But then when it‚Äôs convenient for her she says she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know.‚Äù

Then they‚Äôll always give the excuse, ‚Äúoh, we‚Äôre no-carbing! We can‚Äôt eat vegan!‚Äù Even though they had pizza last night. What the hell? For anyone else‚Äôs birthday they‚Äôll cheat on their diet, but I guess it‚Äôs not worth it for vegan food. 

So my parents resolved this by saying, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt force people to eat vegan. I respect that it‚Äôs important to you and it‚Äôs your belief. Next year you can have all vegan, but you just won‚Äôt have your family there. If that‚Äôs more important to you I understand. It‚Äôs your choice.‚Äù

Saying that as if I‚Äôm the extremist choosing some crazy religious belief over my own family. Meanwhile all I‚Äôm asking them to do is go one night a year without killing animals, and they‚Äôre the ones choosing that over me!

P.S. the ‚Äúthey like protein!‚Äù comment may sound condescending and sarcastic, but it‚Äôs genuinely just ignorant. My mom equates the word ‚Äúprotein‚Äù with ‚Äúmeat.‚Äù As in, ‚ÄúI feel like a piece of protein for dinner.‚Äù I hate this language because it confuses people into thinking vegans are lacking essential nutrients, but at this point her ignorance is intentional.",vegan

He‚Äôs not vegan but loves it there so much- it‚Äôs now the only dessert/bakery we ever have.

Well i overbought and the desserts got  completely cleaned out. Everyone wanted to try everything and had nothing negative to say. Not one utterance of vegan bingo.  

We went to dinner at a seafood restaurant where it was a salad & fries situation- but I came late and wasn‚Äôt complaining. The fries were big, fat impressive wedges and the Asian salad had a delicious creamy dressing that was still vegan. 

 Everyone was very considerate about letting me choose somewhere next. We went to a local fast/casual mediterranean chain at my suggestion and everyone loved it. 

The next night they happily let me choose again and they agreed to go to one of my favorite plant-forward restaurants. They have a local tofu that‚Äôs delicious that i talked up and my uncle had it on a Buddha bowl, and my aunt had a bean burger. I had a mushroom and kale pesto pizza with vegan cheese on it, and brussel sprouts as a starter. 

Everyone agreed they were the best brussel sprouts they had ever had and enjoyed their dinner. My cousin had a slice of my pizza and so did my dad and they LOVED it and helped me finish it- my dad said he‚Äôd split my vegan pizza with me next time. I was shocked they liked the vegan cheese and kinda downplayed it just in case‚Ä¶ but i had such a GOOD vegan weekend with family. That doesn‚Äôt always happen in the American south. My dad has come a long way and loves trying new things with me- and could not be more supportive. Even things he doesn‚Äôt like- he just says he has to try a few more times to get his palette adjusted. 

I‚Äôm just - really really happy that this was how this weekend went. It was so wholesome but i swear it wasn‚Äôt this easy at first. I‚Äôve been vegan for 6+ years and have been determined to be patient and resilient in the face of vegan bingo comments, and it‚Äôs really paid off. The world has changed and softened to veganism a bit, and I‚Äôve learned how to navigate social situations through trial and error.

I know this is not going to be everyone‚Äôs experience‚Ä¶ but you never know‚Ä¶ people can surprise you with time and patience. There‚Äôs always so many negative experiences posted on here which is totally valid- we need to be there for each other to vent‚Ä¶ but i wanted to post a positive family vegan story for once, and i hope it made someone smile or feel hopeful.

Every weekend, we would gather and kick dogs. For a long time, I was kicking them every single day. I felt so much pleasure kicking dogs.

I love animals, so I felt a conflict between my habits and my morals.
So I started only kicking dogs once a week.
Then I stopped altogether.

But one day, I accidentally stepped on a dog's tail in the street. From then I couldn't go back!
I realized that the ""not kicking dogs"" lifestyle is not for me. I've read somewhere that some people are meant to kick dogs.

So I started kicking dogs again. I posted a video of the first dog I kicked on the r/exnonkickingdogs and they were very encouraging, saying things like ""Congrats, it's good for you"".

After all, if you kick a dog humanely, it is still ethical.  As long as they have a good life.

After this, I decided to open a kicking dog farm, in which we breed and sell dogs to be kicked. All the dogs are very well treated. My wife and I treat our dogs like we treat our children. 
They have a good life, and when it's time to kick them, we kick them.

The OP asked a simple question: she wanted to know if anyone had recommendations for vegan hiking boots. A few folks offered up some suggestions, and almost as many replied with smart-ass comments: ""Why do you want to eat your boots, har har?"" One a-hole replied ""You better hover over the trails instead of walking on them. Don't want to damage nature.""

The OP didn't attack anyone, wasn't ""forcing her beliefs down our throats"", just asked a simple question. And these jerks could have easily just moved on with their day if they weren't interested. But no, they felt the need to weigh in with lame, low-effort jokes/hostility that we've all heard a million times already ... I know, people on the internet are horrible, but it just gets old. Understanding why a vegan wouldn't wear leather should take less time than it takes to type out that idiotic joke. But they can't be bothered.

Anyways so one of my closest friend has this insanely large chicken farm business (among other businesses) and he posted a story of all the thousands upon thousands of chicken that are trapped in small cages in his farm. I called him at midnight and had a 3 hour long conversation about how I know him very well and he wouldn‚Äôt want to enter his deathbed knowing that he was responsible for the misery of millions. He initially justified his farm by all sort of stuff such as feeding the population, etc etc etc. But near the 3 hour mark he‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre right, there‚Äôs no way to justify animal exploitation‚Äù. 

I was happy I got him to agree, but I didn‚Äôt know what would happen to the farm. Anyways, 4 days later he sent me a video of the entire farm, completely empty of chicken. He took an incredible financial loss and shut down the entire farm. But in exchange I had to become a full vegan now, and not a year later. That‚Äôs a trade I‚Äôll take any day of the week. 

Also, huge shout out to EarthlingEd, without whom neither my debate with my friend nor my own transition would‚Äôve been possible. And to VCJ for letting me express my newfound moral superiority.

Our animal liberation demonstration was the most hostile I've ever witnessed,1080,13i75cy,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/13i75cy/our_animal_liberation_demonstration_was_the_most/,1684154481.0,"Yesterday, we held a demonstration in our city. A couple of hundreds participants. All vegan messaging about animal liberation, no mention of health or environment. 

No major incident happened, but our action drew lots of hate towards us. We had a huge screen on a van displaying graphic footage. Lots of people liked to take photos of themselves saying ""tasty!"" or posing as eating a hamburger. Others booed at us. Most made fun of us. A group of teenagers spat right in front of us. A young man came peacefully to me and then almost ripped apart the silicon cow head I was holding on top of a stick.

In general, the hostility was unheard of. I've been to other demonstrations for different causes and I've never felt this hatred towards the protesters. As you can imagine, virtually all of those people shared the same profile. All men. Actually, groups of men, and all of them tourists. 

That said, there were positive outcomes too. Some people applauded or were shocked at the screen (as if it were the first time they saw this). All in all, the hostile environment only made me want to fight for this more.

Edit: thank you for your support messages :-) I only participated by painting around a dozen signs, so I barely deserve any praise for organizing it.",vegan

Yes it can be a tough transition at first but it doesn't have to take you 15 years of slow and tiny steps.

Yes buying and consuming less animal products is better than not lowering your consumption at all but very real animals are suffering for the products you're still consuming.

If you're actually putting in the effort and working towards the goal then great, but if you knowingly keep consuming these things when you can easily stop then you aren't exactly acting in good faith and I don't think it should be applauded.

So can we please stop praising the tiniest of steps over decades and encourage people to do the very easy thing of actually going vegan?

We're here for the animals, not stroking egos of people barely putting in an effort.

One snarky comment was something to the effect of it being a 'Golfer, an invasive creature that uses all of the water in the local habitat and destroys the land'. Fine, I realize golf courses aren't super environmentally friendly. This comment was upvoted more than 1000x.

But when I pointed out that animal agriculture uses 100x the water of golf courses nation-wide and additionally emits dangerous amounts of the worst greenhouse gases while utilizing and destroying more than 800 million acres of land, compared to golf's 2 million acres, I was downvoted immediately by a bunch of people. I didn't even really go into the most horrific aspects of animal agriculture, which is the systemic torture and suffering of conscious creatures.

I'm happy to criticize golf courses and their environmental impact, but it's literally next to nothing in comparison to animal agriculture. And adopting a vegan diet is the most accessible way to help the environment and there are basically no barriers to entry.

Student offers question about where the emissions are coming from. I answered to the best of my ability while keeping it simple, which is ""mostly the energy sector, like how we produce our electricity and power our machines, but after that, a large amount also comes from animal agriculture"".

Student says ""ok, but we can't just stop eating meat though"". Yay, teachable moment! ""It's actually totally fine to live without eating meat, in fact the science shows on average it's one of the healthiest ways to live""

""No.""

""I'm sorry?""

""No. Sorry, I just can't believe you can be vegan and healthy""

""Um. Well, you're welcome to believe what you'd like, but that's what the available scientific evidence shows. Every study done on all-cause mortality versus different diets all have plant-based as a top-performing diet""

""What about protein?""

""There are plant proteins. World records have been set by vegan weightlifters""

""Ok? And? Well what about milk? You're gonna get osteoporosis""

""So, many plant-based milks actually have more calcium than dairy""

""No they don't""

**I request some kindness given my recent phase where I almost ended my life.**

I had been vegan for almost 7 years. Meat-free for 9 years. But I have decided that I can no longer do this. I have struggling privately to maintain a healthy plant-based diet.

That I already had OCD did not help. Mental health problems are health problems. And everyone knows mental health issues justify anything and everything. So as I passed my local dog meat market, I could no longer ignore the part of my mind that said I need the meat.

My opposition to factory farming remains unchanged, as do my views regarding the need to view dogs as morally worthy beings whose interests ethically matter. Because everyone knows killing dogs in factories is wrong. However I am no longer convinced of the appropriateness of an individual-focused boycott in responding to these problems, and am increasingly doubtful of the practicability of maintaining a healthy dogless diet in the long-term (again, for reasons hope to go into in more detail at a later date).

I am especially sorry to those who are now vegan activists on account of my content, and hope that they know I will still effort with you to bring about the end of factory farming of dogs.",vegan

I am so angry!! Why do people associate veganism to feminine nature. Why do people think it's ridiculous when a guy opens up about being vegan. Why is male veganism stigmatized in the society??

I believe that a lot of men don't go vegan because unfortunately in the society we live, eating meat is often associated with masculinity and strength. So some men may feel pressured to adhere to these 'gender norms' and consume animal products as a way of expressing their masculinity. And there are  also some people who think vegans 'care about poor animals' and they're fragile and emotional and so again it makes them seem less manly. I believe there's so many guys out there who genuinely want to go vegan but are scared of being judged. Hence, this is an emergency and male veganism should be advocated.

Shrooms Turned Me Vegan,874,15qj0tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/15qj0tv/shrooms_turned_me_vegan/,1691983766.0,"Hey r/vegan !

I wanted to share my story with somebody and just found out about this sub, so here it is!

I‚Äôve been struggling with my diet for the last half a year or so. I was desperately looking for some way to become healthier - both physically and mentally -, lose the extra weight and feel like myself again. I started researching about diet, nutrition, fasting and the microbiome, and decided to make a drastic change to my lifestyle in order to pull myself put of this bad place.

The first thing I stumbled into on this journey was the Paleo Diet. I was really taken in by ll the lecturers and speakers I was listening to, so I started it immediately. I ate once or twice a day, usually a big, fatty piece of meat, some dairy or eggs, as well as some veggies, fruits and nuts at the end. I also started doing some light exercises daily. 

In the beginning I felt great! I had more energy, I was feeling happier and I lost almost all extra weight. Although how much that was due to the fasting and exercising, and how much due to the diet itself may be a different question. However, after about a month or two I started feeling quite sick and couldn‚Äôt really put my finger on it. It was also getting quite expensive, even though I never over-indulged. 

One day while browsing on YouTube I stumbled on the channel ‚ÄúPlant Chompers‚Äù (which I highly recommend!) and started to question my presumptions. It took a lot of mental effort and quite some time, but I started to be more skeptical and critical towards what I though I already knew. 

Skip some time ahead and I was getting close to my long-awaited mushrooms trip. Coming close to it I also watched the movie ‚ÄúEarthlings‚Äù mere days before the trip, which made a huge impact on me; probably all of you have already watched it, but I‚Äôd still like to highly recommend it!

And so, a few days after that and I had my trip. It was a core-shaking experience on so many levels that I‚Äôd need to spend paragraphs trying to describe it, but one of the things that made the most impact on me was my experience regarding animals. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Trigger Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è 

I was ‚Äúshifted‚Äù or ‚Äútransported‚Äù into the perspectives of different animals that are being used for food and food products. 

I experienced being a pig, trapped in a claustrophobic space, being scared, confused, being force-fed and whipped and shouted at without knowing for what reason, only praying that I would be put out without too much pain.

I experienced being a chicken, trapped in a crowded cage, fed a sickening food while the confined space made everybody so neurotic we were al pecking and fighting each other, so they had to cut our beaks and nails.

I experienced being a cow, shackled into place and milked like a machine, while my children were being taken away from me as soon as I saw them never to see them again.

The same thing happened for other animals as well.

There was so much fear, pain, anger, sorrow, loneliness, grief‚Ä¶ And all of it experienced again, and again, and again every single day by millions upon millions of creatures. It wasn‚Äôt just seeing it, but feeling it, even physically acting it out and pushing my head against my boyfriend a if I were trapped in a cage and banging against it. I don‚Äôt remember crying so much in my entire life. 

This was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. I started this journey because of health, but now I‚Äôm also staying for the compassion - permanently. Nobody deserved to suffer like this, especially when it is done for nothing but the pleasure of another creature‚Äôs taste buds.

Thank you for sticking though my story; I wish all of you a great day! ^^",vegan

It's really not. It's so starchy and has that typical coconut oil taste which is just weird and really chemical-tasting. It smells really bad and I gagged when I ate it melted. It still has that plastic-y feel to it.

Maybe I'm in the minority here but I find vegan cheese abysmal. It's a real shame. I just feel that companies really don't try hard when it comes to vegan cheese. They just make a beige block and call it a day.

""vegans aren't empathetic because they force their beliefs on others and I'm tired of it. (long winded rant about how everyone deserves to do whatever they want judgement free)""

""eggs tho""

""vegan products harm the earth""

""plants feel pain""

""i'm not vegan but i respect the earth as native americans do"" (lol wut)

""cheese tho""

""ethically sourced milk""

""veganism is unhealthy and i almost died from it"" (but insists they did everything right)

""i have a farm and kill my own animals HUMANELY"" (yes very empathetic)

and my favorite: ""i eat milk and bacon but that doesn't make me any less empathetic for animals"".

It's so wild that a sub about being EMPATHETIC would be full of people being... non empathetic. As we often say here, ""I don't care"" is the only response we can't argue with. It's gross to me that people continue to do things they know is wrong and instead of just being honest and saying they don't care, they come up with every excuse in the book to make themselves look and feel better about doing it.

We invested $75.000 of our life savings in our vegan business and are struggling on the marketing side. Do you have similar experiences?,810,z16kci,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/z16kci/we_invested_75000_of_our_life_savings_in_our/,1669056191.0,"**Disclaimer**: This is not an advertisement, this is my private account and not my business account.

**Background story, feel free to skip:**

My wife and I decided to start a vegan business. We are selling apparel and merchandise with a focus on veganism, climate change and environmentalism.

When my wife turned vegan (ü•≥) she wanted to buy vegan merch, but did not find much that suited her taste. She asked me if I could design something for her and from there we started to think about doing this in a more professional way.

Since we are both fortunate enough to have good paying jobs, our goal was never to build a business where we would make a fortune with. Therefore we decided to donate most of our earnings to NGOs with a focus on veganism and fighting climate change. If we could spread the word with our apparel, help some organizations financially and cover the running costs (not the original investment) - that would be awesome! :)

We hired more than 25 artists for some amazing illustrations, got legal consulting, hired a web development agency to do our webshop, found an awesome writer (here from r/vegan üíö) and hired a marketing agency.

We contacted a lot of suppliers, made dozens of test orders before we found a supplier that would meet most of our requirements.A few months later, everything is up and running and we are super happy with the products and the webshop.

But‚Ä¶

**We are struggling hard on the marketing side**

and I‚Äôm really curious if some of you have similar experiences and I would be more than grateful for any advice.

Like mentioned above, we are working with a marketing agency. They are all nice people and the communication is great, but the results are quite mediocre. Since they are not in the vegan community, the ads are quite generic (they advised us that even for niches a more general approach is always the best). We are also running our own design ads, to make some internal A/B-testing ‚Äúagainst‚Äù the agency.Since we are currently in our first month, we do not expect big leaps. We are totally aware that it needs months to build brand awareness. But let‚Äôs talk facts:We are currently running ads on

* Reddit
* Facebook
* Instagram
* Pinterest
* Google
* (No Twitter is on purpose)

with mixed results.

**What are the issues that we are facing?**

* Since most of our prints (and descriptions) are about veganism or climate change a lot of our ads get rejected and it‚Äôs quite a hustle to get them even running. Especially Facebook/Instagram classify them as political and only the most tame and boring ads get approved. Our original idea was to run provoking campaigns, which seems impossible on these platforms. But even on the more ‚Äúopen‚Äù platforms like reddit a lot of ads get rejected, because of political reasons. That is super frustrating and I would be interested if you guys had something similar in the past?
* I have to admit that we have no experience in marketing and I - quite naively - thought we just buy some ad slots and that‚Äôs it. But it‚Äôs currently incredibly hard to get any slot at all. Our agency told us that it‚Äôs super hard to run ads as a small business around the Midterms and Black Friday, since all the big companies are buying the slots over price.
* Our click through rates are currently between 3-4,5% which is below average. I think the reason for that is the ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù approach of our current ads, but any interesting ads gets instantly rejected.

**Long story short:**

Vegan business owners, what are your experiences with marketing? What works well for you? Do you work directly with influencers? Do you do non-digital ads?

If you have read till here, thank you so much for your time. You are amazing. :)

We all arranged the funeral service together but at some point they told me they had booked and paid for the wake which made me think why she is my mum it's my responsibility to plan this stuff 

I asked them for the details like where what are the serving and they wouldn't tell me so I asked did you order dead baby pigs and dead baby birds ? YES.....

How to eat healthy while homeless? Best advice for eating a whole foods diet while spending as little as possible?,761,yf3wxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/yf3wxc/how_to_eat_healthy_while_homeless_best_advice_for/,1666906053.0,"For context, I currently live in a homeless shelter in Rhode Island. The homeless shelter is nice but they don‚Äôt serve meals there (the inhabitants of the shelter end up going to the various local churches that serve breakfast, lunch and dinner). The problem is that all the churches serve meat and dairy heavy dishes, so, being vegan (I‚Äôve been vegan for 5 years), I always skip out. 

There is a kitchen at the homeless shelter but generally speaking, we are not allowed to use it. It was previously open to all the people living at the shelter but people kept making a mess and not cleaning up so they closed it off, so now no one can use it. Not even the refrigerator is allowed to be used. 

Which leaves me in a bit of a pickle. I have a job and make like $400 a week, but most of it ends up going to food, which has really slowed down my ability to save up money and move out of the homeless shelter and into a proper room/apartment. 

I mostly buy beans, hummus, hemp seeds, tomato sauce, micro greens, things like that. But the problem is, I am buying these things 3 times a day in order to feed myself a breakfast, lunch and dinner. I can‚Äôt buy in bulk because I have no where to store it and I can‚Äôt stretch out my foods life span because I can‚Äôt use the refrigerator. Moreover, it ends up costing more because I end up buying, for example, cooked beans in a heatable pouch instead of cheaper canned beans because canned beans are heavier and I have to carry all the food I purchase around with me since I can‚Äôt store it anywhere. 

I have bought some dried foods with a longer life span like rolled oats (which I just heat in a microwave located outside the shelter‚Äôs kitchen, in the lounge area). But I don‚Äôt know if I could eat just oats three times a day for however long it takes to get out of homelessness. 

Furthermore, I run and exercise a lot and I haven‚Äôt felt this great and full of energy ever, but it‚Äôs in large part to all the money I pour into maintaining a strict healthy diet while homeless. But how do I make it financially sustainable?",vegan

And there are indeed health issues related to living in an environment infested with rodents.  But yes, 'plague' was not meant to be taken literally.

 ""Big Bird's feathers are white turkey feathers, dyed yellow. There are approximately 4,000 feathers on the puppet.[20] According to Muppet wrangler Michelle Hickey, Big Bird's feathers are ""hand-glued and backed with a ribbon that is hand-stitched on."" His feathers are also rated from A to D, with only A and B rated feathers making up the puppet. Occasionally C rated feathers are used towards the bottom of the puppet. Hickey also states that the feathers are replaced every two weeks, or after the Muppet has been to an event.[21] Count von Count has taken it upon himself to count the feathers on a number of occasions, each with a different number total. These instances include Episode 0715 (9,743), Episode 1601 (6,448), Learning About Numbers (5,961), Episode 2722 (4,798), and Episode 5015 (6,273).""

Was there single moment that put you off eating meat for good?,735,15dwype,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15dwype,1690752273.0,"For me, I believe it was last night. 

Throughout my whole life I have enjoyed eating meat, especially beef because it's one of the few things my Dad and I share a love for (cooking steaks, smoking brisket, etc.). 

I have always felt guilty about eating beef, but not enough that it ever outright stopped me from consuming it. That is until last night, when I was at a gas station outside Houston, Texas and I heard some somber mooing from a distance. I got out of my car to find where it was coming from and noticed this livestock truck parked across the station. I got close to take a look at the cows inside, and man, could I tell they were frightened. As I approached the truck they all backed away and huddled together, then the mooing got really loud and desperate.

In that moment I wished I could rip the cage open and set them all loose because I know they are probably being transported to a butchering site. But I know, the most realistic way I can personally help right now is to simply stop eating meat and contributing to the demand. So that's what I'm going to try to do. I'm going to try to ween myself off of beef. I have tried to stop cold turkey in the past, but every time it's proven too difficult for me.

Anybody here who used to love eating meat have tips for someone trying to ween themselves off of it? Would love to know what's worked for other people. Thanks.",vegan

You have an industry that's built on the backs of exploiting workers in developing countries under poor conditions. It's also low barrier to entry since we already vote with our dollar on food and clothes we buy and need to extend it to fast fashion brands.

Here are some more reasons:

1. Environmental impact: Fast fashion is one of the most polluting industries globally, with high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and waste generation. By reducing consumption and opting for sustainable and ethically sourced clothing, vegans can contribute to protecting the planet and its inhabitants.
2. Labor exploitation: Fast fashion relies on cheap labor, often in developing countries, where workers are subjected to long hours, low wages, and unsafe working conditions. As a vegan, supporting fair and ethical labor practices should be a priority.
3. Alternative options: There are several vegan and sustainable fashion brands that prioritize ethical and eco-friendly practices, offering high-quality and stylish alternatives to fast fashion. By choosing these options, vegans can align their values with their consumer choices.

Overall, boycotting fast fashion is a way for vegans to extend our commitment to animal welfare to other areas of their lives, contributing to a more compassionate and sustainable world.

There is already a post on this where the poster did an excellent job explaining reasons not to support this industry but it's been closed since and there was significant downvotes on that post.

The German Vegan subreddit just banned drawing comparisons between the way animals are treated and the Holocaust.,702,11955mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/11955mq/the_german_vegan_subreddit_just_banned_drawing/,1677085805.0,"Link to the post: https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganDE/comments/118urpw/wichtige_ank%C3%BCndigung_keine_vergleiche_zwischen/

After a heated debate in a thread, the mods of the /r/VeganDE subreddit have decided to ban any comparison between the Holocaust and the bio-industry. 

Translation of the message of the moderators: 

>Hello dear community,

>It is important to us to keep the discussions here respectful and objective. For this reason, we see it as necessary to prohibit comparisons between animal rights and the Holocaust.

>It is understandable that we animal rights activists want to draw attention to the poor living conditions of animals and that we want to point out the abuses in factory farming. But comparisons with historical tragedies like the Holocaust are not only inappropriate, but also disrespectful towards the victims and survivors of these events.

>Josef Schuster, the President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, says in response to a question from SPIEGEL that comparisons of factory farming with the Shoah are an ""unacceptable relativisation of this singular crime against humanity"": ""In my view, the campaign for a dignified and more conscious treatment of animals, including meat consumption, should do without simple sweeping generalisations and inappropriate supposed parallels.""

>This was also made clear in a decision of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on 8 November 2012 (case no. 43481/09). In this case, an animal welfare organisation in Switzerland had published an advertisement in a newspaper with the inscription ""Holocaust on your plate?"" drawing attention to the cruelty of factory farming.

>The ECtHR ruled that this advertisement violated the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and disrespected the suffering and grief of the survivors and their families. The use of the Holocaust as a metaphor or analogy in this context was inappropriate and disproportionate.

>Similar to the Holocaust, which is an unprecedented crime in history, the suffering of animals should not be relativised. Both issues should be treated respectfully and objectively.

>Animal rights are an important issue that should be discussed seriously. There are many good arguments for our cause. But there are also many ways to do so without instrumentalising the Holocaust in an inappropriate way.

>Therefore, we will not tolerate comparisons between animal rights and the Holocaust to ensure that all discussions on r/VeganDE are fair and respectful.

>Your MOD Team

Edit: Oh and hello to the trolls and non-vegans, trolls aren‚Äôt welcomed, civil conversation between non-vegans is. 

here‚Äôs some vegans (in these comments) who still manage to navigate with their conditions while not allowing it to come at the expense of animals: 

> Allergic to wheat and have IBS-D triggered primarily by onions and corn. Still vegan.

> I have IBD (crohns disease) and on top of it IBS, and I am autistic and therefore super picky with food & textures and yet i'm still plant-based! It's easy to find ways to eat all the nutrients you need without eating animals and harming them. I have 3 amazing excuses yet I don't use them bc tbh as long as you know what works for you you can def make it work!!!!!! Some people's situations are valid ofc, but a lot are just lazy to do the work and uninformed.

> I have a friend who has celiac disrqseand an insane amount of food allergies/ sensativities like tomatoes, corn and almonds and she's still vegan.

> I'm allergic to pollen, causing me to be allergic to raw fruits and veggies, and I'm vegan!

> I have POTS, severe hypothyroidism, severe anemia, IBS, gluten sensitivity, migraines, PMDD, and several anxiety disorders. I'm vegan. Health issues don't stop me.  Health issues aren't an excuse for murder. (I'd like to add I'm healthier than I've EVER been since going vegan.  I don't have IBS flareups as often and my mood has improved.  I also dont eat as much gluten.)

> Idk I feel a lot of it is just bad arguments. I have 2 autoimmune diseases and I need to take (sadly non vegan) meds. I can still do fine. I don‚Äôt think there is a lot of common diseases out there that would make it impossible to go vegan. But I don‚Äôt doubt some people are being badly misinformed by their doctors either ‚Ä¶

> Hi, a poor vegan with gastroparesis & celiac disease who hates tofu

> I have IBS and gluten intolerance, which is more than just a temporary stomachache (as it is sometimes characterized). If anything veganism has allowed me to learn more thoroughly what I can eat, what doesn‚Äôt cause me physical pain or mental anguish by causing suffering. Sure, it‚Äôs restrictive to some, but I have found safe foods and meals that work for me. I‚Äôm also not rich so I‚Äôm not talking about super expensive alternatives either. People can be very discouraging in both gluten free and IBS circles, listing reasons they had to give up or wouldn‚Äôt consider veganism, and comparing it to an eating disorder. For most, they simply don‚Äôt want to give things up.

> Hey there fellow coeliac! üôãJust to add - my vegan journey actually started after my coeliac disease was diagnosed, around six years ago. I had been a flex-vegetarian for years before that, but for one reason or another couldn't take the last step. After being depressed for a while because ""no more pizza, pasta, cinnamon buns or beer ever again"", I realised I actually could have those things, I just needed to swap wheat for something else. And at the same time, it dawned on me that yes, I could swap dairy and eggs, too. If I was able to educate myself on being gluten-free, it most certainly wasn't any more difficult to educate myself on how to give up animal proteins. So here I am, another ""nothing-eater"", still alive after six years üòÅ

> Vegan with IBS-D and celiac, checking in!

> I am a vegan who is allergic to hazelnuts and has a slight sensitivity to almost all raw fruits, vegetables and tree nuts.  I'm also allergic to cow's and sheep's milk (obviously a moot point,) and while this one isn't diagnosed, I suspect I have at least a sensitivity to balsamic vinegar (the rest are diagnosed.) While I wouldn't attempt a raw food diet I find being vegan incredibly easy.  If anything, when it comes to food, I eat too much.

> I have EPI and chronic pancreatitis and my husband has Chrohn's. We manage just fine- I choose lower fat and sugar options, limiting food like nuts or choosing PBfit, and he chooses lower fibre/ low residue when flaring, like white versions of our usual whilefoods. Even when I was suffering really terrible hyperemesis earlier in my pregnancy my dietician was great and prescribed a vegan liquid food replacement (Nualtra foodlink smoothie). I use it now when my pancreas flares and I have to restrict food. If you want to make it work, you usually can 99% of the time. It's very rare that there isn't a way to adapt a vegan diet enough to suit an aversion, allergy or health condition.

> Tree nut allergy vegan checking in! Sucks to miss out on cashew cheese and the good fats in walnuts, but I still have peanut, almond, and coconut on the menu, so I‚Äôm doing ok.

> bf has crohn‚Äôs. can‚Äôt have corn of any kind, tomatoes, peas, nuts, among many things. still vegan lol

One of my roommates (F19) mentioned she was vegetarian when we met. At first this made me happy as, we have 2 fridges in the apartment and this allowed me to convince the others to leave one of the fridges completely meatless. 

On thing though was that my roommate kept mentioning how she had been avoiding meat for longer than me, and therefore has made more of an impact (I became vegetarian 3 years ago and have been vegan for 1 year whereas she's been vegetarian for 9 years apparently)

Except... she's literally not üò≠.

Update: thanks so much everyone for your kind words, it really helped me through this morning. My partner ended up taking me for a drive and we got something for me to eat. When we returned, my Dad apologising for speaking to me that way (I think my sister had words with him once with left about why it wasn‚Äôt ok to yell at me like that). 

He ended up serving my potatoes and it was eaten by everyone, and no one even knew it was vegan. My sister had also organised some things for me to eat, which I hadn‚Äôt known about previously. 

I‚Äôm hoping that my parents are realising the impact this has had - we are meant to be moving back in with them next year (I‚Äôm pregnant and wanted to move back to our home city to be closer to family) and I don‚Äôt think he or my Mum want to risk not being apart of their grandchild‚Äôs life.

I used to support vegan restaurants a lot. But the prices have really skyrocketed since inflation.

We probably ate out 2-3x a week pre-pandemic. 

During the pandemic I really worked on my scratch cooking skills and I don't think you can tell the difference between my food and a restaurants  food. 

Example of the price increases: pre-inflation our favorite place was $10 a sandwich including a small salad. Now it's $17+ $3 for a small salad.

I learned how to replicate their sandwiches (found their cookbook from 20 years ago on eBay).  It now costs me $5-8 for 3 sandwiches.

So I financially know its ridiculous to spend $60+ tip/tax. (Husband, child and me) vs $8.

Today I wanted to go to a town we love to go to, and I googled for a vegan place. The price was so high that I reconsidered going for lunch.  I figured I'll bring some sandwiches.  Their prices started at $20 + sides. And to spend $100 on lunch would make me annoyed,  but I also feel horrible not supporting vegan restaurants.

Would it be weird to drop off a $20 every now and then to our local vegan places, especially since we do not go nearly as much as we used to.",vegan

Quick update- cant thank you enough for the comnents, im 3 days in and i feel great.

First day was a bit difficult but it was my fault, just kept eating veggies with tofu and i still felt hungry, i ate till my theeth hurt and still felt hungry, maybe it wad pshycological but i probably should have ate some bread as well with it

i told my mom yesterday and she went insane, we had a big fight because she said its impossible, which is so ironic because she barely eats meat, barely twice a week 

Today she calmed down a bit, we talked and she showed me how to make beanburger and it wad delicious, she has 40 years of experience so i everything she makes is amazing but being there and seeing how to do it gave me alot of confidence in making it myself.

About my father, we used to go every week to a resturant where they served mostly meat, today i told him that id like for us to go to a falafel( hummus) place instead because im trying to eat less meat (i dont want to scare him with the word vegan since it has a very bad reputation from where i come) he was very nice about it and accapted it which is nice because he is also not going to order meat (its only serving falafal)

Over all im very happy, ill try to keep an update every once in a while, love you all <3",vegan

It was obviously highly triggering for me and I feel so disrespected and disappointed by her. I haven't responded yet because we have both been busy traveling but it has been weighing on my mind ever since. I'm still trying to wrap my head around why she would do something like this. I've been vegan for 5 years now and she knows I did it for the animals. She has always been supportive after my transition and always makes sure there are vegan options available when we eat together. So I'm not only pissed but genuinely confused by her actions.

I'm posting this partially to vent but also to ask for some ideas on how to respond to her. I am still fuming and don't want to say anything out of anger that I may regret. Maybe I can turn this into a teaching moment, I don't know. Would love to hear your thoughts, thanks.

EDIT:

Whoa, had no idea this post would blow up like this. Here's some extra context for those who were asking. She was at a restaurant where the soup was cooking directly at their table on a hot plate. She posted a video of the soup boiling while the poor baby octopus was frantically squirming, trying to get away. I don't know if she posted a video eating it because I stopped watching the rest of her stories.

I was the only person she tagged. AFAIK, she's got at least 4 vegan friends (including me and my husband).

EDIT 2:

Really appreciate the overwhelming support from everyone. Even though there are a lot of differing opinions on how I should move forward, it is extremely validating that we can all agree that what my friend did was beyond fucked up.

Some of you might be familiar with this post on r/TrueOffMyChest from a few weeks back that made the front page of Reddit:

EDIT #2: The original post was removed (Thanks mods), but I have a transcript of it for posterity:

> My wife became a vegetarian 3 years ago during the lock downs. When she told me she wanted to change her diet, I told her that was fine but not to expect me or the kids to follow along with her. I would not expect her to cook me meat, and if we were eating together I would make sure to either cook vegetarian or make sure to cook meat separately from everything else. This worked well, there was literally no problems until this year. At first it started with her getting a bit preachy about things. She would start to tell me or the kids how unhealthy meat was, how cruel the industry was, yada yada. She went Vegan soon after and it has been a living hell since then.  
>  
>A few months ago, out of nowhere, she told me that animals products would not be allowed in the house at all. Obviously she does not just get to say that. I brought up the fact that she agreed that the rest of the family would not have to follow her diet. Our kids are teens, and I'm a fully grown adult. She had a tantrum. A full on toddler tantrum when I told her this. Now, she chastises me and the kids whenever she sees us eating meat. She tried to get the kids to watch documentaries with her, and has meltdowns when they don't want to. She got into a fight with her dad and refused to go to his birthday celebration because they refused to only have a vegan cake (but offered to buy a second one so she could join.)  
>  
>I don't know what happened. I've tried to talk to her about this and she looses her cool with me every time. Her insults just get more bizarre. She calls me and the kids nazi's and says we are supporting the ""modern day holocaust."" The kids are absolutely tired of it. Our son makes fun of her behind her back all the time now, and I'm less and less inclined to stop him. Our daughter refuses to be around her now, and tells me when she moves out of the house that she will never talk to her mom unless something changes.  
>  
>I just want my wife back, now whatever activist monster she's become.

The TL; DR is, some guy‚Äôs wife became a vegan and because of it she became incredibly raving and militant which is now threatening their marriage.

The post received thousands of comments and nearly 20k upvotes, and seems to cement the idea that vegans are crazy uncompromising radicals and cause the erosion of relationships.

It‚Äôs also important to note that this story is 100% bullshit, and is the work of a career Anti-Vegan who goes by many names, but for the purposes of this post, I will be referring to him as Pyrobotnik, who has in the past spread lies about veganism, prominent members of the movement, and has created many personas in attempts to discredit veganism. Here is a motherload of information compiled on my friend‚Äôs blog that catalogs his long and illustrious career of trolling vegans:

Before I get into why this specific story is fiction, I‚Äôm going to have to give a little bit of backstory (there‚Äôs a lot of it, but the links I provide should give you all the context you need). I would‚Äôve addressed this sooner but it only just came to my attention. Better late than never to address it I suppose.

I‚Äôm a moderator for a small Vegan forum called the Philosophical Vegan forum, which was linked earlier (I‚Äôm not trying to plug anything, trust me this is important).

[https://philosophicalvegan.com/index.php](https://philosophicalvegan.com/index.php)

Recently it‚Äôs been pretty inactive, with only a few members joining. One of whom is a user who goes by the name of simply Robert, who created a post last month that is eerily similar in content to the recent TrueOffMyChest post, with a dedicated husband needing to deal with a crazy vegan wife:

[https://philosophicalvegan.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=7717](https://philosophicalvegan.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=7717)

Before any post by a new user is visible, it has to be approved by a moderator. When I first saw the post, I was pretty apprehensive to believe it since (like I stated in the Discord DM I shared in the thread) it‚Äôs very similar to stories created by Pyrobotnik about a family member who went vegan who then gave into the militant and extreme lifestyle.

The reason why I was suspicious of this being Pyrobotnik in particular is because a few years ago, we had a user who went by the name deadeye68, who created a fake anecdote to discredit veganism, this one about his daughter, which IIRC was riddled with contradictions (I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôm not going back and reading all of it, though you‚Äôre welcome to):

[https://philosophicalvegan.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3843&p=37257#p37257](https://philosophicalvegan.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3843&p=37257#p37257)

I remember watching that thread when it was going on, and a little while after that after deadeye left there was a new user that registered who went by satansride72, who also had a story to tell about a crazy vegan:

[https://philosophicalvegan.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=3893&p=37915#p37915](https://philosophicalvegan.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=3893&p=37915#p37915)

The post raised suspicion so after checking the IPs we realized that this satansride user had the same damn IP as deadeye (and another user bigbossomni, though I don‚Äôt remember if that one had a crazy anecdote along with it):

[https://imgur.com/a/hLS4fwd](https://imgur.com/a/hLS4fwd)

OK, so it was a huge troll post and we all fell for it. How do we know it was Pyrobotnik specifically though? Well‚Ä¶

Within the same time frame too (he goes by bosspyro on Reddit, which appears to be a combination of his aliases Pyrobotnik and bigbossomni. It seems he plays TF2, I‚Äôd like to play with him if he still does).

But even with all that, I was willing to give the person the benefit of the doubt, since the forum‚Äôs been on life support and some activity is better than none. I guess I‚Äôm too damn nice for my own good.

I (Red on the forum) made a reply to the post, then Pyrobotnik (Robert) replied, but then user (and Administrator) brimstoneSalad immediately declared his suspicion, which I then followed suit. brimstoneSalad highlighted how it has the patterns of Pyro‚Äôs alter egos, with the crazy and militant vegan. Note that even though we both were suspicious of this being Pyro, we still offered advice and arguments that would still be useful for his situation. Feel free to read the thread and brimstoneSalad‚Äôs post to see all the evidence that points to this being Pyro, it‚Äôs a lot to type here.

Now if this truly were a person who was concerned about his marriage ending and genuinely wanted advice, he would stick around and prove his innocence. But instead of that, he makes a short indignant post about how vegans are all crazy and he left without responding to any of the points we‚Äôve made.

So where does that leave us? Well just a few hours ago, I stumbled across the aforementioned ROMC post, and I was dumbfounded to say the least. If you insist that these aren‚Äôt connected, don‚Äôt you think that it‚Äôs a pretty crazy coincidence that within the same time frame some guy goes complaining to the internet about his new crazy vegan wife (albeit with some modifications to the story)? If you look at the threads with Pyro‚Äôs personas and compare them here, don‚Äôt you think they‚Äôre a little too similar?

Not only is this Pyro‚Äôs MO, about a month before we had ANOTHER user who went by the name Kwashiorkor who claimed to be a vegetarian, who made posts that were filled with racist and sexist and downright horrendous claims. I didn‚Äôt completely suspect Pyro then, but I did claim my suspicions:

>I'm becoming increasingly convinced that you aren't a vegetarian or vegan, you're an anti vegan troll who is trying to make the movement look like it's full of insane racist and misogynistic incels so as to undermine it. These remarks are far too outlandish that even people who unironically believe this shit wouldn't say, because even they know it's batshit. Either that, or you're THAT desperate for attention you'll say anything. And you wonder why no one likes you.

[https://philosophicalvegan.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=6174](https://philosophicalvegan.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=6174)

He didn‚Äôt run away that time since I didn‚Äôt say he was Pyro I guess.

While I don‚Äôt have a screenshot to show since I don‚Äôt have access, he has a VERY similar IP to Robert, and the same service provider, just with the last two numbers different. It's also a little coincidental that both joined the same obscure forum at roughly the same time, don't you think?

And while I have not seen this myself, brimstoneSalad says that Pyro has a history of misogyny, and the posts by both users shows it well, with psychopathic incel still from Kwashirokor the loyal and dedicated husband needing to appease his crazy wife since that‚Äôs what a gentleman does (a supreme gentleman, perhaps?).

From my recollection, Mr. Pyrobotnik agreed to end his long career of trolling a few years back, but I suppose he got bored and decided to bring it back. Why does he do what he does? I have no clue. I suppose it‚Äôs fun though.

Now, maybe, maybe, MAYBE, there is a tiny, tiny, tiny chance that they are not the same person. Maybe a .0001% chance that these two individuals are unrelated. I have a very difficult time believing that though (as stated earlier, everything is far too coincidental).

I highly doubt users who saw that post are going to see this, and this post might get buried, but I figured I should get this off \*my\* chest at the very least. I might be missing a few things, if so I‚Äôll make an addendum to this, since I have  to get going now.",vegan

Bad Dairy,640,z3iu8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/z3iu8z/bad_dairy/,1669293334.0,"So I (37m) started a new job a few months ago and one afternoon a colleague saw me eating a vegan chocolate bar at my desk and must have assumed that I was vegan.

The next day when the plans for lunch were being discussed, one of the guys asked me if I wanted to get a burger and the other told him that I was vegan so then the whole office thought I was vegan when at that point, I wasn't. Instead of correcting them, I decided to go with it, thinking that it might encourage me to make healthier food choices, in the office at least.

After a week or so, I decided to change my whole diet to vegan and that's led me to discover that dairy has been the root cause of a lifelong problem I've had with persistant mouth ulcers and skin breakouts. Up until then, at any given time, I would have had 3-4 mouth ulcers and usually my skin would have broken out on my face and shoulders when they were particularly bad but since removing dairy from my diet, I've not had a single ulcer and my skin has completely cleared up.

It's amazing what a change in diet can do.

\[EDIT\]: I should comment seeing as it's been a talking point. While the animal welfare issue wasn't the reason I switched to a vegan diet, I've always been vocally anti-fur and I've always been someone to never knowingly use animal products like leather. There's probably more I can still do with my lifestyle but I'm already feeling the benefits of switching diet so I'll be looking more into other things I can change in my lifestyle.",vegan

After asking for the 'regular' stuff and being told it wasn't available for January, they decided out of embarrassment to try the vegan food. Fair enough. While waiting, they proceeded to play excuse bingo, going through a few reasons why they couldn't be vegan before eventually settling on 'its too expensive'... despite the fact that the food on the menu they thought was meat is the same price as the vegan food they are actually getting. The very fact they are in the restaurant by mistake invalidates the excuse. 2 minutes later one of them is talking about flying to LA (this is in London, UK, so at least ¬£600) and going to Coachella, so I hardly think they're below the poverty line.

Not only does it not make a jot of difference, other than having the shop contact the dairy, butchers, or farm and placing another large order, but I think without a doubt that it drives people away from veganism or even reducing meat/dairy intake. When people say that vegans are self-righteous, smug, militant, annoying, cry-babies, I don't disagree with them purely for the fact that these morons are giving us a bad name.

Hello all, after spending all my life eating meat, I‚Äôve recently come to realise that it‚Äôs pretty inarguable that the consumption and killing of animals is unethical.

Starting this week I‚Äôm going to turn to a full vegan diet. Some quick info, health is extremely important to me, I spend a lot of time in the gym/taking care of my body and watching my diet so making such a drastic change to my lifestyle raises some questions.

I just want to clarify, even if a fully carnivorous diet is healthier I would still opt for a vegan diet due to ethical or moral reasons, the reason I say this is because although this is a vegan subreddit, I hope you can give me non biased, truthful answers without worrying that I will not commit because I heard something I didn‚Äôt want to.

So my questions are.

1. Would such a drastic shift in diet be a shock to my body as someone who has eaten meat all their life? Should I ease into the diet or can I just immediately begin no problem?

2. Will there be any physical or strength losses that I would have to accept going into this diet?

3. Can all my recommended nutrients, proteins and vitamins be gained through a vegan diet, or will I have to use supplements to make up for a lack of some? 

4. Is a vegan diet really much more expensive, or is that a myth?

I‚Äôm wholly ignorant on the current scientific consensus on the health outcomes of eating meat so excuse me if these are dumb questions. I understand that these questions can probably be answered quickly through Google and I definitely will research more in my own time but when making this decision I‚Äôve only researched the moral/ethical arguments of Veganism and none about how to actually begin incorporating it into my lifestyle. 

Thanks all.",vegan

Her stepdad manages a kitchen and prides himself on his cooking but won't make even the slightest effort for us and it's getting old.  I'd honestly be fine skipping all of these events since I hate trying to eat at the same table as a dead animal but when I don't go they start teasing my girlfriend about being a vegan and she ends up miserable.  It's already annoying that I'm going to have to grit my teeth and pretend to not be bothered by the sight and smells of flesh and I'll have to prepare something ahead of time for us to have a decent meal, but someone's probably going to have snide comments about our food while we're expected not to bring anything up so we don't make anyone feel bad.

It's exhausting and carnists really have no clue how old it gets.  I'm tired of people acting like we're the jerks when we just want the bare minimum of not having to bring our whole ass meal every time and then defend our choices without hurting their feelings.  

With Thanksgiving coming up, I plan to cook plenty of bright, colorful sides that look way better than the secretion soaked canned veggies available.  If I'm going to have to go through this song and dance again, I might as well find my own joy in making a damn good meal that makes them a little jealous, even if they can't admit it.

I almost printed out a study showing that beets increase athletic performance, but then idk, just didn't. I probably should have. Instead, I included a card saying it included pistachios and cashews (as a potential allergy notice). I stupidly told the hosts that it was vegan. 

Nobody ate it. NOBODY. Except for my son. It was the only thing he \*could\* eat aside from a few slices of unbuttered bread. The veg pastas were mac and cheese and cheese tortelini. The garlic bread was made with butter. Pasta is one of the easiest damned things to make vegan and yet he couldn't eat any of the pastas. 

And it was maybe the most delicious salad I've ever made. So at least we got to eat if for dinner when he got back.

I have raised my kid to be vegan, literally from the womb.

He‚Äôs extremely sensitive like me, so I was blessed with not having to deal with him wanting anything other than vegan food, clothing, etc. 

Now that he‚Äôs in middle school, he wants to fit in. First it was about the candy and desserts (easily replaced). Now, it‚Äôs a Discord vegan leather wool jacket (wth??). I tell him that we can watch a doc, and after that, we can discuss why he still wants to be carnist. He said he‚Äôs not bothered by violence, and the only animals he now cares about are his pets (rescues). 

I remained calm, but through tears, told him I needed time to process this. I can‚Äôt go to my partner with this, bc he‚Äôs a carnist. Our compromise is that, at home, everything is vegan. When he‚Äôs out of the home, he can have what he wants. I hate it, but here we are 15 years later. 

Does anyone have experience with this? I‚Äôm afraid if I keep pushing, he will never want to be vegan ever again. If I let him choose, I still run the risk of him never being vegan.

I‚Äôve been on vacation in northern Florida with my family (boyfriend, me, and kid) visiting the BFs friend that lives here. The friend is of course an omnivore. 

We spend most of our meals compromising for this friend. He wants to show us the cool restaurants he likes. Alright, awesome. We are accommodating people and want to experience his city with him, but we end up eating vegetarian dishes (of which there is normally one or two options on the menu) and have to remove cheese or mayos/dairy sauces and make it a very lack luster meal by the end of the modifications to get us as close to vegan as possible. 

On the last dinner here I request a vegan restaurant. We send him the link. He‚Äôs all good to go. We get there and he overhears us saying ‚Äúeverything is vegan‚Äù and he goes ‚Äúwhat? What about fried shrimp on the menu?‚Äù. Completely flabbergasted. He cannot believe he is somewhere he cannot choose meat. He admitted later that he considered walking down the street to eat somewhere else. 

He proceeded to give the cashier a hard time and make light of the vegan menu. We sat down and there was another omnivore he found camaraderie with that only made him more brazen. They brought us our utensils and they were made of wood. He loudly exclaimed ‚Äúhey these are vegan too!‚Äù For the whole restaurant to hear. At this point I told him the hurdle he was having such a hard time getting over was just eating some vegetables. He then had to be reminded that he was the minority in the restaurant and most of the people there were vegan or adjacent. 

I was floored that he was so rude.  Embarasssed for the amazing woman who I could tell was the owner. She said it was entertaining but I know. We know. Our eyes roll and our blood boils inside.

While vegans typically take the stance that the sacrifice of veganism is worth it to avoid animal suffering, it is still framed as a sacrifice nonetheless.

This is an implied framing of veganism that we should not accept. In my experience, being vegan isn't something I tolerate because I'm morally obligated. **It is an actively positive force in my life.**

Thanks to veganism, I have understood myself and the world better than I did before. I've tasted amazing meals, learned to cook better, and thought deeper about my values. I am more empathetic to not only animals but people as well. **I am more fulfilled because I live in line with my values every day instead of waiting for some hypothetical future to solve important problems for me.**

Understanding the oppressive human-animal hierarchy puts other oppressive hierarchies in clearer focus. The tendency for the oppressors to compare the oppressed to animals is not a coincidence but a pattern that deserves to be dissected. How does the commodification of animals lead to and support the commodification of people? These connections would not have presented themselves to me if I wasn't vegan.

So I'm grateful I was blessed with being introduced to veganism, and I hope other people are lucky enough to experience it.",vegan

I've possibly just straight up started stealing oatmilk from carnist places,569,xyt3di,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/xyt3di/ive_possibly_just_straight_up_started_stealing/,1665236407.0,"For some reason on my campus there's literally 0 place that sells coffee with oat milk. They have these mini fridges stocked with free 2% dairy, half and half dairy, skim milk etc. but if you want oat milk you have to buy this tiny little oat milk box separately and pour maybe half of it into your coffee. It's bullshit. The other day someone clearly just picked up one of those oat milk cartons and left it next to the cow's milk cartons in the 'free milk' fridge. For some reason that gave me the confidence to just pour it into my coffee instead of paying extra just to buy one for one coffee, which was so fucking satisfying.

What am I living in? A nightmare?,563,15wlige,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/15wlige/what_am_i_living_in_a_nightmare/,1692562175.0,"Its not fair. People shouldnt be allowed to eat animals. Why the fuck am I looked down on for being against abusing and killing animals!!?? We dont have to eat them so what the fuck!!!????? Im so sick of not being able to talk about the horrific things happening to them to keep other people comfortable! And when you do talk about it, people say its like youre forceful, you're preaching religion, keep the peace. 

Why the fuck can good people who ""care"" about animals eat them even when they know what happens to them?? When I saw pigs in those gas chambers it physically broke my heart and I cryed my eyes out. I swore I would never and could never eat their bodies again. Why is this world so crazy? We're fucking normal for godsakes, everyones against abuse and cruelty so what the fuck!? 

I just want to give up and stop caring about being considerate or not saying something every time they eat them. I do try to be tolerable but Its getting to a point where Im so sick of it. I just want to tell everyone blankly, youre an animal abuser, coward, hypocrite, murderer.

Its almost like fuck caring if people think im judging anymore. Like yeah i didnt, i do my best not to when people dont know. But how can you sit and shake your head at abuse and violence and then get mad at me for telling you pigs are subjected to abuse and violence??

It should be illegal for them to have a corpse on their table. I shouldnt be a minority arguing with dog lovers about killing animals. All animals deserve the right to not be fucking sliced and stabbed across the throat, electrocuted, put in a gas chamber, shot in the head, suffocated, bashed with a shovel, have their children stolen, entire families separated, murdered in front of each other, murdered AT ALL.

Im so sick of being nice for people who say they care and then continue to eat MURDER VICTIMS. If youre not VEGAN, YOU are an ANIMAL ABUSER.

She first lured me in first talking about how the ASPCA helps dogs involved in dog fighting, rescuing them and helping them recover from the abuse they experience in the industry. I was all on board until she started advocating for humane breeding, an example she gave was breeding pugs in a way where they genetically prevent the breathing problems they often have. She also briefly talked about advocating for better living conditions for farmed animals, but wasn‚Äôt against the slaughter/consumption of animals. 

Bottom line she was trying to get me to sign up with my credit card to agree to a monthly contribution of $25 a month. I told her I was vegan and I‚Äôm all for animals rights and ending animal cruelty, however, without doing more research on the organization and where their money goes, I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable committing to a monthly contribution on the spot. I did however offer to give her a one time cash donation that I had on me, she refused my cash donation saying it‚Äôs illegal for her to accept cash. She kept pushing for me to sign up with my credit card for the monthly contribution, I  told her that because she‚Äôs a stranger on the streets, nor do I know about the security or legitimacy of the website your entering my credit card info in that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable. I then counter offered, offering to go on the ASPCA website myself with my phone in front of her and putting in a one time contribution, and she wasn‚Äôt interested in me doing that because she said she had a quota to hit. I told her if she really was for the animals it shouldn‚Äôt matter if you get credit or not for my donation. 

I continued by saying that I think if I were to give monthly money to any organization, I would want to give money to an org that aligned even more with my vegan values. She responded by telling me that Veganism is a privilege, and asked what about the single mother with 5 children, how can she possibly afford to be vegan. I told her that‚Äôs a common misconception since the cheapest foods in the grocery store, like lentils, beans, and rice are vegan. I also said, if someone is in a position of privilege, wouldn‚Äôt it be a good thing for someone to use that privilege to be vegan. Besides, wouldn‚Äôt it also be a privilege to be able to afford the $25 monthly contribution she was trying to get me to agree too.

Anyway, I just left the convo really surprised, especially since we were two people who were both passionate about helping animals, but then have two completely different view points on the matter. 

Does anyone have any thoughts on ASPCA? Are they the most aligned with our vegan values?",vegan
Dating sucks (or maybe I just date the wrong people),563,11cswpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/11cswpp/dating_sucks_or_maybe_i_just_date_the_wrong_people/,1677446063.0,"Dated a guy now for 6 months. I knew from the beginning that he thought veganism is ‚Äûweird‚Äú but I gave him the benefit of the doubt since he never met one before and I have made the experience in the past that people do tend to soften up to some topics through exposure. 


He did soften up a bit to it. I never forced it on him in any way and our relationship was going along quite fine. 


Now his family was always a big topic. They are quite conservative (for our region) and tend to think anything not the norm is just strange and something you don‚Äôt want to be a part of. 


Today he was at a family gathering, called me after and told me that there would have been no vegan food for me. As always I told him that that would not bother me. He told me that it would bother the host and he would feel like a bad host. The conversation escalated a bit, with me trying to explain to him (again) that veganism is a very important value to me. He tried to convince me to make exceptions at parties so that his family doesn‚Äôt feel bad. They would already talk shit about me behind my back if they would find out that I‚Äôm vegan (his words). He then continued to tell me how I am so self centered and not empathetic towards people since I don‚Äôt care if I hurt their feelings. I hung up (with a notice) and since then I am just really upset. To hear that hurt and to be so misunderstood and not listend to too. 


I don‚Äôt know, I guess I just wanted to vent somewhere where I know people will not think that I am strange for the things I believe in.

I found that really interesting, and it made me wonder if the actress was vegan in real life (why else would they have So Delicious on set, especially when the character is not vegan, and when the other ice cream in-scene was not vegan?). 

Not only is Emily Deschanel vegan, she's been vegan since she was 17! And she's raising her children vegan!

Vegan Starbucks worker here. Don't order the new impossible breakfast sandwich.,9178,hej15c,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/hej15c/vegan_starbucks_worker_here_dont_order_the_new/,1592933682.0,"I saw a lot of vegans asking on the Starbucks reddit if they can order the sandwich vegan and a lot of the responses are ""sure! Just ask for it without egg and cheese!"" But here's why you shouldn't order it...

All of our sandwiches come frozen and prepackaged. So if you order it without the egg and cheese, the egg and cheese will just get taken off and thrown away and wasted. Because of this, I feel that buying this sandwich is still contributing to animal cruelty bc you're still buying the sandwich with the animal products. 

On top of that, I saw some people say that the bun has milk in it. 

If you want a better option, try the dunkin beyond sausage sandwich without the egg and cheese. I'm pretty sure theirs aren't prepackaged bc i think VegNews promoted it and one time I went and they said that their buns were frozen so they just gave me the beyond sausage patty.

Anyway, I just wanted to warn my fellow vegans because there's a lot of non-vegans who don't seem to understand why there's an issue that are saying it can be made vegan!

Edit: it is confirmed in the comments that the bun is not vegan either.

A lot of people are also upset for allergy reasons, and I just wanted to say that Starbucks does have on their menu a statement saying that they can't guarantee that any product is free of allergens. It's so that they won't be held legally liable. You could report them I guess, but it unfortunately might be a waste of energy :( I ALWAYS let people know of ingredients with common allergens (i.e. when someone wants a white chocolate mocha latte with almond milk, I warn them that the white chocolate mocha syrup has milk in it). Unfortunately though, we're not taught what ingredients have what allergens, and we're not told to warn people either because Starbucks assumes people will do the research on their own. 

If you have an allergy please be careful.",vegan

I'm totally pissed and I need to vent.

My father's birthday was last weekend and since he is one of the ""I don't want any gifts""-guy I thought it would be a good idea if I would buy cake for the whole family (\~30 people). I asked my mother and she told me it was a good idea.

I'm very lucky to live right across the street from a vegan cafe. They have awesome cakes (pictures in the comments). So I bought a lot of cake for 70‚Ç¨ (>80$), drove to my parents and prepared the cake for the family. My mother made also her Streuselkuchen (crumb cake) that she always makes.

So everybody sat down to have some coffee and cake and my uncle loudly proclaims how awesome the cakes look like today and asked my mother where she bought them. My mother told them, that I bought them.

In a split second my sister turns to me around and asks freaking loud: **ALL THE CAKES ARE VEGANISTIC?!?!**

I ignored the word ""veganistic"" (wtf?) and told her: Yeah, it's quite easy to bake vegan. Flour and sugar is already vegan and replacing milk, butter and eggs is super easy.

**NO ONE** (except my wife and my father) ate one single piece of cake. They all shared the Streuselkuchen of my mother which was maybe for 10 people.

I told them several times that the cake tastes awesome and there is nothing inside that they would not eat, but they straight up told me that they don't want to eat ""that"".

Funnily enough they were pissed, probably because I was the reason they didn't had enough cake.

**Why are people like that? Why?**",vegan

Vegans and 5G conspiracy beliefs,4165,gnrkif,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/gnrkif/vegans_and_5g_conspiracy_beliefs/,1590042081.0,"Earlier today a prominent local vegan activist put up a (now-deleted) call on Facebook for protests against COVID-19 lockdowns, and the comments were immediately filled with vegan antivaxxers raving about 5G, chemtrails, and the NWO.

This nonsense cannot be allowed to take hold in the vegan community. We already struggle against the perception that vegans are crystal-waving hippy idiots. Having a bunch of people running around blending veganism with outlandish conspiracy theories would be a disaster.

Call this stuff out wherever it pops up. We need to make clear that vegan conspiracy theorists are a fringe of the movement just as they're a fringe of mainstream society.

Please, please don't propagate scientifically unsound and cultish concepts when it comes to nutrition. It makes vegans, and veganism, look terrible.

For example:

* Eating a high carbohydrate diet is NOT some magical panacea against disease and weight gain
* Eating a vegan diet is NOT a cure-all
* Eating fats is NOT a death knell
* ""Detoxing"" and ""cleanses"" are NOT scientifically backed, at all
* High fruit diets are NOT superior to diets with plenty of variety
* Eating a vegan diet does NOT automatically mean that diet is healthy

No clickbait, just a conversation.",4072,az0cc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/az0cc9/actually_met_someone_who_worked_at_a/,1552111029.0,"Tonight I met someone that worked at cargill highriver (Alberta, Canada) meat processing facility, and here is some of the stuff I learned.

-5000 cattle are killed and processed per day there


-16 hours a day, two 8 hour shifts


-1 cow is killed onsite every 11.5 seconds


-""It's impossible to stun and kill every cow properly because of time constraints.""


-Bolt's are used to stun cattle before they go to the bleed line


-""Cow's are smart, they are terrified waiting in line watching slaughter, and sometimes some cows try to dodge the bolt.""







-""Some cows proceed to the bleed line with bolts driven into their eyes, or their skull impaled with metal bolts and are still alive. They don't have time to make sure every cow is bolted properly and it goes down to the bleed line regardless, even if they miss.""



-You get fired if caught with a cell phone while at work (worried about taking videos etc, he took these videos on his last day). 




-even after ineffectively being bolted, and ineffectively having their throats slits, SOME cows have proceeded to the processing lines while still alive, where they have limbs chopped off




-he has heard of cows being skinned while still being alive after the stunning line and bleeding line. (He said there is no time to check every cow, and the line can't be halted because a bolt was missed or a throat was improperly slit). 




-The holding lots cows are brought into are kept behind the building, with no public road access, so nobody can see the sheer number of cows sent for slaughter there every day. 




-The lunch room at the cargill plant is called ""feedlot"", which can be seen on the video of the bathroom tour video at the end of the hallway. How fucking depressing would it be to work there and go to the ""feedlot"" for your break....





-the bathroom is a disgusting 3rd world shit hole




-cockroaches are in the facility, so much so that he had to be careful about his clothing coming home to make sure that no cockroaches came home with him. 




-Super depressing working conditions



-""the thing that really touched me, I didn't know cow's cried, I thought only people cried, but I saw cow's cry while waiting in line to get bolted, and it broke my heart"".




FUCK ANIMAL AGRICULTURE!!!!! This shit is real, right here at home. Every day, by the hundreds, thousands, millions, and billions. Only so people can have shit shoveled down their gullets by animal agriculture + the animal food industry.



Note: I posted this to an alberta vegan facebook group, but felt like sharing it here too.... hence the video references but posting vids on reddit is a pain sorry lads. 



Edit: Here's the video footage of the employee bathroom (disgusting), locker area, and the main hall with the employee break area called ""Feedlot"". 


Also a video of part of the processing area, and an image of the overall facility. He had to be low key with his cell phone footage because it's a big deal to get caught with, but he took what he could.

Reasons why I'm refusing to self-isolate during the COVID-19 pandemic:,3973,fn6p1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/fn6p1z/reasons_why_im_refusing_to_selfisolate_during_the/,1584909310.0,"* There's no way the whole world is going to self-isolate so why should I? One person can't make a difference.

* It's unhealthy to stay out of the sun and enjoy the company of fellow humans.

* It's expensive.

* Self-isolationists shouldn't force their beliefs on others. They should live and let live. I mean, I don't force THEM to go out and socialise.

* I just enjoy the feeling of being with friends in the pub.

* It doesn't harm other people who are out, enjoying themselves, anyway.

* You say it's immoral...? Morality is subjective and going out feels right to me.

* It's a cultural thing. In my country, socialising is the norm. My ancestors did it.

* I know people will die but it's the circle of life. As long as they die humanely and with respect, it's all OK. After all, they'd die eventually, anyway.

* If it came to a choice of going out and socialising or starving to death on a desert island, which would you choose?

* We evolved from apes...apes are social creatures.

* If people didn't die, the world would be overpopulated.

* There are better ways to promote self-isolation. The in-your-face approach from most self-righteous self-isolationists just puts normal people off the idea.

Recognise any of these arguments? This is the sort of shit that Vegans hear every day. Sounds different when it affects YOU or your elderly loved ones, directly, doesn't it‚ÄΩ",vegan

I‚Äôm officially going Vegan. After watching ‚ÄúSeaspiracy‚Äù... my lifelong love of seafood and meat crumbled before my eyes. It‚Äôs time for me to stand up and do what‚Äôs right.,3449,mgrh27,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/mgrh27/im_officially_going_vegan_after_watching/,1617142610.0,"I have two younger sisters that have been Vegan for years and they have tried to get me to do the same... but I just never wanted to do it! I guess I tried to ignore *how* my food got to me because the reality was a little hard to stomach. So naturally, as a selfish human, I repressed the facts and continued to indulge in animal products. 

This morning, all of that changed. Watching ‚ÄúSeaspiracy‚Äù on Netflix literally broke my heart. I love my planet... I love the ocean, I love the whales? I love the dolphins, the sea turtles, the fishies.... but how dare I ever say that if I am contributing to the extinction of the most gentle creatures in the sea?!? 

As the documentary ended, my stomach initially churned with disgust in myself. ‚ÄúNo more seafood!‚Äù I said to myself.  But then instantly, I remember one of the whale poachers saying that he saw it no different than the meat industry... and he has a damn good point. 

I love animals. I love this planet. I want to do whatever it takes to save it... and despite my LOVE for meat (like, you guys have no idea, I love LOVE love seafood and meat), I‚Äôm ready to put it behind me. I‚Äôve tasted some delicious plant based alternatives before, as per the generosity of my sisters... so I know that I‚Äôll be able to continue enjoying the juicy flavors and textures of our fuzzy and fishy friends. Plant based foods have come such a long way!! 


I know this is probably a very boring and jumbled post... but I don‚Äôt have anyone to really talk to about it right now and I feel like such a new woman already. I‚Äôm ready to do my part and I just hope that the whole world can begin to feel this way, too. 

I‚Äôm going in for the whole nine yards. NO animal products, not just food, will ever be purchased by myself or my boyfriend ever again. I can‚Äôt believe it took me so long... but I‚Äôm glad I finally got here. 

I‚Äôm ready to do my part to save the planet.

Edit: wow! I can‚Äôt believe the amount of you that commented. I‚Äôm scrolling through the replies now and the encouragement is just so uplifting... it‚Äôs also incredible how many of you watched the same documentary and decided to make the same changes. Let‚Äôs save this planet!! (:",vegan
